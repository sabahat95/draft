New Age BD,"Jan 26,2021",Enforcement failure leaves highways to accident risks,"While the movement of vehicles with differing speeds is the prime reason behind the escalating number of accidents on highways, there are other factors that compromise passengers’ safety; and they include unskilled drivers behind the wheel, exhaustion of drivers from working long hours, a lack of monitoring of black spots on highways and more. All these issues are explicitly addressed in government orders, High Court directives and the existing laws. In 2018, the prime minister gave directives to ensure drivers’ rest every five hours, alternative drivers for long distance transports and the setting-up of resting facility for drivers on highways. In April 2019, the national road safety committee submitted its 111-point recommendation to the prime minister that provided elaborate guidelines to prevent fatal accidents on highways emphasising the introduction of service lanes for slow moving vehicles, setting speed limit in accident-prone areas, keeping the connection points between national highways and feeder roads in check and regular inspections of black spots on national highways. The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority chairman has too acknowledged that the recommendations and directives need to be strictly implemented and that without service lanes on highways for three-wheelers and alternative transport for passengers, it is not possible to deter accidents. Yet the directives and government orders sadly remain unimplemented.For decades, committees have been formed, recommendations made to prevent road accidents in Bangladesh, but they remain unenforced. Half-hearted enforcement of the Road Transport Act 2018, which was enacted following a youth movement for road safety in October 2018 and saw a partial enforcement in November 2019, is a case in point. It is time that the government truly committed to the cause of road safety and ensured strict enforcement of its orders and existing laws. It must immediately take steps to ensure that slow moving vehicles do not ply the highways, but, in so doing, it must arrange for alternative transport for the people using these vehicles.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/128270/enforcement-failure-leaves-highways-to-accident-risks
New Age BD,"Jan 24,2021"," Highway accidents rampant as laws, directives ignored in Bangladesh ","Road safety experts blamed mostly the movement of unregistered vehicles, including three-wheelers, the absence of service lanes and highway side infrastructures and kitchen markets, for the accidents. The lack of institutional capacity and accountability and enforcement of laws and regulations by the authorities concerned were also blamed for the situation.Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on June 25, 2018 gave directives to ensure drivers’ rest every five hours, alternative drivers for long distance transports and use of seatbelts while travelling.The High Court on August 3, 2015 issued a directive to the road transport ministry and the police issued to keep unfit motor vehicles off the roads across the country.Since August 1, 2015, road transport and bridges ministry imposed a ban on three-wheelers and non-motorised vehicles on different national highways.Lastly on April 28, 2019, the committee headed by former shipping minister Shajahan Khan submitted 111 recommendations to the prime minister with a view to bringing back order on roads and reduce the number of accidents across the country.Some of these recommendations related to the national highways include: removal of highway side kitchen markets, infrastructures and shops, introduction of service roads and grade separation for slow-moving vehicles, setting up of bus stoppages and bay areas and passenger shades, setting speed limit in the accident-prone areas, keeping the connection points between national highways and feeder roads in check, ensuring regular inspections of black spots on national highways and safety measures to reduce accidents, building trauma centres and fire service stations at strategic places and ensuring BRTC bus and truck services at short distances to facilitate local passengers. These directives had already been mentioned in the then Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983 and in the Road Transport Act, 2018, Bangladesh Labour Act, 2009 and traffic laws.The removal of unfit vehicles from roads, using alternative drivers, allocating rest rooms for drivers, ensuring the use of seatbelts, introducing service lanes and keeping an eye on feeder roads to keep anomalies in check are yet to be implemented.Reports of New Age correspondents from different districts showed rampant violation of these directives.On Monday at Rajfulbaria and Rajabari areas on Dhaka-Aricha national highway different three- and four-wheeler vehicles were seen running.Rickshaws were seen parked on the Nabinagar bus stand intersection while the highway did not have any service lane.New Age correspondent in Mymensingh reported that the movement of unregistered vehicles was increasing in the district and causing fatal accidents regularly.Mymensingh traffic police inspector Syed Mahbubur Rahman said that even after a series of awareness programmes three-wheelers are plying on the highway.New Age correspondent in Sylhet reported that the movement of three-wheelers and other unfit vehicles on the highways in Sylhet zone still continue.Sylhet highway zone police superintendent Shahid Ullah said that CNG-run auto-rickshaws were responsible for most of the casualties on highways while more than 800 auto-rickshaws were sued in the last month alone.CNG-run Auto-Rickshaw Drivers Association’ Sylhet divisional unit president Mohammed Zakaria told New Age that the movement of auto-rickshaws on highways remains a huge risk before the introduction of service lanes.From Tangail New Age correspondent reported that unregistered vehicles regularly crossed the Dhaka-Tangail highway due to the absence of service lane at Gorai, Pakulla, Korotia, Ashakpur and Rabna points and between Elenga bus stand and Ibrahimbad.Professor Shamsul Hoque, former director of Accident Research Institute under Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, alleged that the institutions concerned did not have the capacity and they lacked coordination to check these violations of directives and laws.He said that accountability of the authorities concerned and political ownership would ensure some major solutions to the problems.Road Safety Foundation executive director Saidur Rahman observed that all of these directives remained neglected. Strict implementation of the existing laws could ensure order on highways and prevent accidents, he added.At least 5,431 people were killed and 7,379 injured in 4,735 road accidents in the country in 2020, said a report published by the Road Safety Foundation.The report also shows that 38.24 per cent of all accidents occurred on national highways.According to Nirapad Sarak Chai, in 2020, most of the road accidents occurred on highways while a major reason behind these was the movement of slow-moving vehicles on highways.A report of the Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Association showed that in 2020 around 28 per cent road accidents involved three-wheelers, battery-run and unregistered vehicles locally known as nasimon and karimon.Bangladesh Road Transport Authority chairman Nur Mohammad Mazumder told New Age on Thursday that close monitoring of all authorities concerned and creating alternative transports and service lanes for slow-moving vehicles on highways were necessary to implement the directives.They had no authentic statistics on the unregistered vehicles, he said, adding that they were trying to make people aware about the directives.More

New Age BD,"Aug 18,2020"," Govt must enhance, institutionalise drivers’ training ","Moreover, wide allegations are there that applicants seeking driving licences or the licence-holders seeking renewal of their licences often dispense with the necessary training and skills tests with the help of corrupt officials. What is also worrying is that the gap between the number of driving licences and the number of registered vehicles has but only widened in recent years. Official records show that about a half of the motor vehicles are in the hands of drivers without licences — as of June 2019, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority registered 4.6 million motor vehicles but issued 2.2 million driving licences, which suggests that half of the vehicles so far registered are run by drivers without driving licences. Such a situation points to the inefficiency and inadequacy of the training facilities. There are only 17 government and 135 private driving schools and about 180 instructors, which is significantly low compare to the demand. Authorities too admitted that the there is a huge shortage of training facilities for professional and non-professional drivers, but they have failed to address the situation. Given the consistent rise in the number of road accidents, half of which are believed to be caused by unskilled driving, the authorities should no longer leave the issue unattended.The government, under the circumstances, must take up initiatives on an urgent basis to improve and expand training facilities for both drivers and driving students. The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority’s plans to build driving institutions at all 64 districts must be implemented at the earliest and the agency must also widen and enhance its training programmes so as to include non-professional drivers too. More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/113742/govt-must-enhance-institutionalise-drivers-training

New Age BD,"Aug 16,2020",Insufficient training for drivers increases risk of fatal accidents,"Currently, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority provides a two-day mandatory training only to professional drivers during the renewal process of their driving licences once every five years.At present, due to the coronavirus-induced crisis the training was downsized to one day.There are no mandatory training facilities for non-professional drivers and motorcyclists by the BRTA till now, said the authority chairman Nur Mohammad Mazumder.Road safety experts said that it is mandatory to give regular and extensive training to both professional and non-professional drivers and motorcyclists.They said that a huge number of motorcyclists are now registered under professional ridesharing services, a trend which also poses a threat to safety on roads.According to the BRTA, at present the number of professional male drivers in the country is 17,53,576 and non-professional male drivers is 14,50,902.The number of professional female drivers is 1,316 and non-professional female drivers is 31,782.The persons holding licence for driving motorcycles are listed as non-professional drivers while currently, under the ridesharing services, more than one lakh motorcyclists are registered to carry passengers as a profession.BRTA training department director Md Sirajul Islam told New Age that between 2008-09 and 2019-20 fiscals, under the refresher training programme, they provided training to 4,63,769 professional drivers.Professor Mizanur Rahman, director of Accident Research Institute at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said that Bangladesh needed professional drivers properly trained through regular and elaborate training programmes.He said that when applying for driving licence people had to answer some multiple-choice questions and face a field test, which were not enough to measure their skills.Regular training would contribute to the reduction of the number of road accidents, he said.‘Alongside the BRTA, the owners of buses also should take responsibility for giving training to the driver working for them,’ he said.The professor also said that as the number of motorcycles under ridesharing services was increasing they, along with non-professional drivers, should also be facilitated through a similar training programme.Nirapad Sarak Chai women affairs secretary Manjuly Kazi alleged that the authorities lacked sufficient training facilities for drivers in the country.Without skilled and trained drivers, fatal accidents on roads would not be reduced, she added. Since 2008-2009 fiscals, the BRTA started to provide refresher training to enhance the professional skills and awareness of professional drivers every year when they come to renew their light, medium and heavy driving licences for vehicles including car, bus, and truck, every five years.All licence holders have to participate in the training before they can finally renew their licences.Sirajul Islam said that in the current 2020-21 fiscal they had set a target to train 80,000 professional drivers while till Thursday total 5,603 drivers received training as due to the epidemic, between March 26 and May 30, all government offices had remained closed.Officials said that before epidemic the two-day training comprised of presentation of documentary and discussion on road safety, traffic signs and signals, road marking, law and health issues, moral education, maintenance of vehicles and licence procedure.After the discussion session, drivers take part in practical tests, which they need to pass to get certificates to renew their licences.‘We have plans to build driving training institutions at 64 districts in phases for providing training facilities to all,’ BRTA chairman Nur Mohammad Mazumder told New Age.In the first phase, they selected 19 districts and prepared detailed project proposals for building institutions at Mymensingh, Rangamati, Cumilla, Noakhali and Faridpur districts.A report of Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh shows that at least 368 people were killed and 518 injured in 358 road accidents in the country in June this year. Compared with May, the number of accidents in June increased, the report shows.According to the BRTA, there are 128 motor driving training schools and 183 motor driving training instructors registered under it.Besides the authority, Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation provides training to its drivers and it also provides training commercially to non-professional drivers.Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training also provides training to Bangladeshi expatriate workers.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/113606/insufficient-training-for-drivers-increases-risk-of-fatal-accidents

New Age BD,"Mar 24,2020",Lenient enforcement of law won’t change the road regime,"The BRTA statistics show that applications for new driving licences was 39,263 in November and 37,440 in December of 2019 while the figure was 28,827 for January and 13,539 for February this year. Similar decline is recorded in the applications for licence renewal and type change. While a decline in February is understandable given the fear of COVID-19 infection, but the number of applications are generally low. It suggests that the very purpose of a relaxed implementation, which was decided on the ground that it would give transport owners and workers enough time to update their papers works, was defeated. The overall road safety situation, statistics show, has deteriorated with a half of the grace period for the opportunities gone and amidst a lack of monitoring by the authorities and the reluctance of drivers and transport owners to comply with the law. According to the Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh, road accidents have been on the rise in the past few months — with 547 people killed in January 2020 and 534 killed in February. A record number of deaths were reported in 2019 — at least 5,227 people were killed in 4,702 road accidents across the country. The Accident Research Institute rightly points out that a lenient enforcement of the law is one of the reasons behind the increase in the number of fatal road accidents in recent months.The government and its agencies responsible, under the circumstances, must not be lenient in the enforcement of the Road Transport Act 2018. Vehicle owners and drivers must also show responsibility and collect or renew necessary licences within the grace period. Above all, a concerted effort of all parties concerned is a must to bring the much-needed change in the chaotic road regime before it takes more lives.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/103024/lenient-enforcement-of-law-wont-change-the-road-regime
New Age BD,"Mar 23,2020",Fatal road accidents on,"In November last, the government announced special opportunities for vehicle drivers for the next seven months to renew their licences or obtain new licences on easy conditions after the Road Transport Act 2018 was relaxed.But as in the past, drivers are reluctant this time also to take new or proper updated licences.Instead of the number of applications for new or updated driving licences going up at the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority offices, there was a marked decline in the number of such applications this year.Meanwhile, the overall safety situation on the roads has deteriorated with a half of the grace period for the opportunities gone.Road safety experts blamed the lack of monitoring by the authorities and the reluctance of drivers and transport owners to comply with the law for this undesirable situation.BRTA officials said that though they were trying to encourage drivers to get new and update old licences there was an absence of responsible attitude among them.Counting from 1994, the highest number of people killed in road accidents was in 2019, as per Bangladesh Police statistics.According to the police, at least 4,138 people were killed and 4,411 injured in 4,147 accidents in 2019.Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh data shows that road accidents killed 547 people and injured 1,141 in January 2020 while 534 were killed and 1,169 injured in February.Following the countrywide student protests for safe roads in 2018, the current road law came into effect on November 1, 2019 more than 13 months after it was enacted in September 2018.The law enforcement agencies are now implementing the law partially after home minister Asaduzzaman Khan at a meeting on November 23, 2019 gave the transport workers and owners time until June 30 this year to have proper driving licences and fitness certificates.On January 20 this year, the BRTA put on hold until June 30 the fines for failing to update vehicle documents like fitness certificates, tax tokens and route permits and driving licences.According to the BRTA, the number of applications for new driving licences was 39,263 in November and 37,440 in December of 2019 while the figure was 28,827 for January this year and 13,539 for February.The number of applications for renewing driving licences was 9,418 in November last year which rose to 11,962 in December. The figure for January this year was 9,583 which plummeted to 3,405 in February.Declines were also seen in the number of applications filed for changing the types of licences as 2,902 such applications were made in November and 3,226 in December. The figure for January decreased to 2,904 and for February dropped to1,436.Accident Research Institute of Bangladesh University of Environment and Technology director Professor Md Mizanur Rahman on Friday told New Age that transport workers received similar opportunities from time to time but they never took these seriously.‘The government and the transport owners should strictly monitor the situation and ask the drivers to collect licences,’ he said, adding that the initiative almost failed as half of the time allotted for the purpose had already gone by.Mizanur also said that the relaxations made in the law were one of the reasons the number of fatal road accidents went up.As the law was softened the workers did not want to follow the rules and became more reckless, said Passenger Welfare Association secretary general Mozammel Hoque Chowdhury.He urged the authorities to strictly implement the law. BRTA chairman Md Kamrul Ahsan on Thursday told New Age that they were only one of many stakeholders responsible for improving the situation on the roads.First of all, the drivers should be more aware of the need to run the vehicles on the road while the owners have to watch them and law enforcement agencies have to enforce the law, he observed.Replying to a question, he said that it was difficult to say why the number of applications for new and updated driving licences and for changing the types of driving licence was falling.‘We are encouraging drivers to obtain driving licences while there could be some problems at individual levels,’ he added.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/102992/fatal-road-accidents-on

New Age BD,"Feb 13,2020",No respite in sight from traffic accident death,"The issue of compensation strongly raised by the families still remains unresolved. The latest road law, as road safety campaigners argue, has left the victims worse off than the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1983 did. The ordinance provisioned for the victims to file cases against insurance providers and vehicle owners if insurance coverage was inadequate. The new law replaced this right of the victim to file cases for compensation with a right to ‘apply for compensation’ from a ‘financial aid fund’ that is to be set up with government grants, contributions from vehicle owners, fines realised under the act and grants from vehicle owners and workers’ associations. It imposes no specific compensation liability on vehicle owners whose employees cause a road accident death or injury. Such a legal ambiguity, as victim families argue, protects negligent owners. In a number of cases recently, the High Court has ordered the vehicle owners concerned to pay compensation to victims, but the owners have exploited the legal bureaucracy to avoid paying any money. The family of Rajib Hossain, who died after losing his hand after being stuck between two buses did not get any compensation over a legal wrangle after the owners of the two buses in question were ordered to pay Tk 1 crore to the family.A system must, therefore, be developed to compensate the victims of road accident to ensure a greater accountability in the road transport sector. Such a provision, as experts have for long argued, will in turn improve road safety by making the vehicle and transport company owners and insurers support a proper driver’s training and more rigorous enforcement of vehicle fitness standards. An easy access to compensation may at least allow victim families to recover from the losses.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/99378/no-respite-in-sight-from-traffic-accident-death

33 in Barishal Metropolitan Police areas.The authority does not have any more previous recorded statistics, said officials.At a press conference, held on Tuesday at Bangladesh Crime Reporters’ Association auditorium in the capital, some of the guardians of fatal road accident victims joined forces to express their dissatisfaction over the existing lawlessness that prevails on roads across the country.The conference was jointly organised by Forum of Guardians of Children and Relatives in Road Accidents and Nirapad Sarak Andolan.Liza Akter, sister of Md Abid, a Secondary School Certificate examinee who died on January 27 this year when a vehicle of WASA ran over him at Wari, alleged that after first hit his brother was alive but when the reckless driver fatally ran him over by the vehicle for the second time to flee, he died.A case was filed at Wari police station and the alleged driver was in jail while some people were creating pressure on them to withdrew the case, she alleged.‘I know I’ll not get back my little brother but I got more frustrated when I heard that the driver got bail from jail within few days,’ said Md Nazim Uddin, elder brother of Md Saiful Islam, 27, who died when a Balaka Paribahan bus fatally hit his motorbike at Joarshahara area on October 31, 2019.Father of Adnan Tasin who died on February 11 last year at Shewra area in the capital when an Uttara Paribahan bus ran over him, Ahsanullah Tutul, alleged that he asked for justice from the police and even mayors but was yet to get any justice.At the programme Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh secretary general Mozammel Hoque Chowdhury said that without punishment the accidents would continue.Following the countrywide student protests for safe roads in 2018, the road law came into effect on November 1, 2019 more than 13 months after its enactment in September 2018.The government began enforcing the law on November 17 amid countrywide protests by transport workers only to backtrack as transport workers demanded making cases to be filed against drivers bailable, issuing driving licence in a short time with easy conditions and allowing all modified goods-carrying vehicles to operate.Currently the law enforcing agencies are enforcing the law partially after the government gave time to the transport workers and owners until June 30, 2020 to update driving licences and fitness certificates.The apex body on road safety — the National Road Safety Council — formed a committee led by the former shipping minister Shajahan Khan, also executive president of Bangladesh Road Transport Workers’ Federation, who submitted 111 recommendations to bring back order on roads and control accidents to the prime minister Sheikh Hasina on April 28 same year.On October 15 a 33-member taskforce was formed to implement the recommendations and on November 24 the taskforce head, home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, formed four sub-committees to submit action plans and recommendations within two months.BRTA chairman Md Kamrul Ahsan told New Age that as per his observance, carelessness of the drivers and tendency to defy laws were reasons behind fatal accidents.The authorities were continuing with enforcement activities but what was needed was a coordinated effort to curb fatal road accidents, he added. Accident Research Institute of Bangladesh University of Environment and Technology director professor Md Mizanur Rahman termed the situation as alarming.He said that the number of fatalities and accidents were more than the recorded incidents and blamed the culture of not following laws as a major reason behind this situation.Meanwhile as per ARI, which compiled road accident data based on statistics from the police, newspapers and television channels, at least 4,357 people were killed and 7,226 were injured in 3,936 accidents in 2019 while 4,076 were killed and 8,715 other injured in 3,513 accidents in 2018.More

New Age BD,"Dec 02,2019"," At least 24 people killed, 18 hurt in Tunisia road accident ","At least 24 Tunisians were killed and 18 more injured when a bus plunged into a ravine on Sunday, in one of the country’s worst road accidents.The bus had set off from Tunis to the picturesque northern mountain town of Ain Draham, a popular autumn destination for Tunisians near the Algerian border, the tourism ministry said.Twenty-four people were killed and 18 injured, the victims aged between 20 and 30, said the health ministry.An AFP team that went to the scene saw the mangled remains of the bus leaning on its side in the ravine near a river bed, with its seats scattered around the crash site.The top of the bus appears to have been torn off and bodies, some in sports clothes and trainers, were strewn across the ground.A sign reading in English ‘Sweet Time Travel’ — apparently the name of the travel agency that ferried the tourists from Tunis — lay among the debris.The bus with 43 people on board was travelling through the northern Ain Snoussi region when it veered off the road, the interior ministry said.The vehicle had ‘fallen into a ravine after crashing through an iron barrier’, it said on its Facebook page.The injured were transferred to nearby hospitals, it added.Forensic experts were deployed to investigate the crash, AFP correspondents said.It was not immediately clear what caused the accident, but Tunisian roads are known to be dangerous and run-down.Tourism minister Rene Trabelsi told a private radio station Mosaique FM that the ‘unfortunate accident took place in a difficult area’ and just after the bus had taken a ‘sharp bend’.A civil defence official, speaking on state television, said there had previously been deadly accidents at the same spot.Khaled Ayadi, who had arrived at the scene after the accident, told AFP he saw the bodies of ‘people scattered all around and blood’.He said that he and other motorists who had stopped by the side of the road started to help and try to retrieve the bodies until the rescuers arrived and took over the gruesome task.‘On this road there are always accidents, especially trucks. We must find a solution for this road so there are no more accidents,’ Ayadi said, adding that Sunday’s accident was overwhelming.Social network users bemoaned the tragedy. ‘What a heavy toll,’ one of them said.Another denounced the ‘roads of death’ in Tunisia and wrote: ‘24 dead and no one from the government has declared a national catastrophe’.The World Health Organisation in 2015 said Tunisia had the second worst traffic death rate per capita in North Africa, behind only war-torn Libya.Experts blamed run-down roads, reckless driving and poor vehicle maintenance for a rise in accidents the following year.Tunisian president Kais Saied and prime minister Youssef Chahed visited the scene of Sunday’s accident, one of Tunisia’s worst.In April, seven women day labourers were among 12 people killed when the pickup truck taking them to work collided with a minivan in the impoverished central region of Sidi Bouzid.In August 2016, at least 16 people were killed and 85 others wounded in another road accident in the mountainous region of Kasserine.The authorities recognise the scale of the problem but have said the country’s security challenges, including jihadist attacks, have kept them from giving it more attention.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/92439/at-least-24-people-killed-18-hurt-in-tunisia-road-accident
New Age BD,"Dec 01,2019"," Drivers, assistant get life term ","A Dhaka court on Sunday sentenced two drivers and a helper of two buses to life term imprisonment in the case over a 2018 road accident in the capital that killed two college students and injured 10 to 15 others.The accident, caused by a reckless race between two buses of the Jabal-e-Noor Paribahan company, on the Airport Road killed Diya Khanam Mim, 17, and Abdul Karim Rajib, 18 – both students of Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College – on July 29, 2018.The reckless and tragic road accident sparked a country-wide non-violent student protests, including a seemingly unstoppable one in the capital, for safe roads across the country.Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge KM Imrul Kayes pronounced the verdict against the drivers – Masum Billah and Zobair Sumon – and helper of one of the buses Kazi Asad, also fining them Tk 50,000 each, in default, to suffer six more months in jail, for committing culpable homicide.Masum and Zobair heard the verdict from the dock while Asad was still absconding.The court, however, acquitted one of the bus owners Jahangir Alam and helper Enayet of the bus driven by Masum as the accusations against them were not proved.The court found that helper Enayet repeatedly warned driver Masum Billah to drive the bus carefully and of consequences of reckless driving.Besides, the prosecution could not prove the charge of negligence against Jahangir, the court said.The court observed that the drivers and helpers drove the vehicles roughly only for earning a small amount of money.‘The incident involving Rajib and Diya touched the heart of the nation and the civil society. The drivers and the helper engaged in a competition knowing its consequences and did so only to pick a passenger for earning extra money without showing minimum honour to human beings,’ the court said.They had been driving heavy vehicles without having licenses from the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, it added.‘Everywhere in the country, drivers and helpers recklessly do the driving, killing citizens, including students, which should be stopped. Owners of vehicles also create pressure on drivers and helpers to pay more money by giving them vehicles on contract. This is why drivers and helpers engage in competition to carry more and more passenger to earn more and more,’ the court said.Besides, the drivers having licenses to drive light vehicles should be kept away from driving heavy vehicles, the court observed.        The court announced the verdict after examining 37 prosecution witnesses.Defence lawyer Hasim Uddin said that his clients were denied justice, adding that the court handed the sentence based only on the judicial statements from 164 of the accused and on student protests.His clients would go to the higher court challenging the verdict, he said and added: ‘The court did not examine any eyewitness in the case.’ Public prosecutor Abu Abdullah, however, said that the prosecution could prove the case against the accused and that the road sector would be peaceful because of this judgment.   Diya and Rajib were killed and 10-15 others injured as one of the two buses of the Jabal-e-Noor Paribahan company involved in a race ploughed through a number of students on Airport Road in front of Kurmitola General Hospital on July 29, 2018.Victim Mim’s father Jahangir Alam lodged a case with Dhaka Cantonment Police Station in this connection.The police at the time said that the buses did not have route permits and the drivers proper licenses.On September 6, 2018, inspector Kazi Shariful Islam of the detective branch of police who investigated the case submitted charge sheet against six people – drivers Masum and Zobair, helpers Asad and Enayet and bus owners Jahangir and Shahadat Hossain – and the court accepted the charges.On October 25, 2018, the Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge’s court indicted the six and their trial began on November 1.On November 7 the same year, a High Court bench stayed the trial proceedings against Shahdat as he challenged indicting him in the case.The trial of the remaining five ended on November 14, 2019.The tragic end of the two students on road angered the students across the country, including Dhaka, and they took to the streets protesting against the incident and to press home a set of demands.Those included taking all responsibilities by the government of the families of the deceased and injured, compelling the buses to carry students, half fare for them, not allowing buses without fitness and driven by any unlicensed driver anywhere in the country and ban on carrying passengers by public transports in excess of their capacity, highest punishment for the bus drivers responsible for the killing of the two, establishing footbridges and taking safety measures for safe movement of students, establishing speed-breakers in accident-prone areas including in front of the schools and colleges.Most of their demands are yet to be fulfilled.Against the backdrop of student protests and demand from other road safety campaigners, the Jatiya Sangsad on September 19, 2018 passed the Road Transport Act 2018 which was put into effect on November 1, 2019.However, the government backed out of implementing the new law in the face of country-wide protests from road transport owners and workers who wanted suspension of the law until further amendments.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/92343/drivers-assistant-get-life-term
New Age BD,"Nov 30,2019",Heavy vehicles blamed for most fatal accidents,"They also said that reckless driving, movement of small vehicles and lack of service lanes on highways as well as indifferent attitudes of the authorities resulted in the situation.After the recent spate of countrywide strike by the transport workers the authorities allowed the drivers to drive any vehicle till June 30, 2020 with the driving licences they have now.Within this time they would receive appropriate licences from the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, the authorities decided.Experts and road safety campaigners said that the workers should use this opportunity to improve the situation under close monitoring of the authorities.A report compiled by the Bangladesh Police shows that 2,236 people were killed and 2,325 injured in 2,174 road accidents across the country in the first seven months of this year.Among these accidents, the highest, 696, involved buses while 668 involved trucks and covered vans and 334 involved motorcycles, the report shows.Another report, compiled by the Accident Research Institute of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, also reveals that buses and trucks have been responsible for the majority of fatal road accidents, especially in the Dhaka district.This report was based on reports published in newspapers.In 2016, the involvement of buses and trucks in road accidents was 51 per cent and 11 per cent respectively both across the country and in the capital, it shows.Across the country, the year 2017 saw the involvement of buses in road accidents decreasing to 25 per cent and that of trucks rising to 22 per cent.The involvement of buses in accidents throughout the country went further down to 23 per cent in 2018 and to 21 per cent till October 18 this year and the involvement of trucks remained 22 per cent in 2018 and till October this year.In the capital in 2017, the involvement of buses in accidents was 45 per cent while that of trucks 11 per cent.The involvement of buses in city road accidents declined to 36 per cent in 2018 and till October this year to 33 per cent while in 2018 the involvement of trucks increased to 17 per cent but remained the same till October this year, the report adds.According to yet another report, compiled by the Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh, between 2015 and 2018 buses were involved in road accidents in highest proportion, 21.33 per cent, followed by 21.18 per cent by trucks and covered vans.Accident Research Institute director Professor Mizanur Rahman told New Age that a collision between two big-sized vehicles created a heavy impact resulting in high fatalities.In case of a clash between a big vehicle and a small one the small vehicle suffers much more damages and thus passengers of small vehicles die more, he also said.He observed that most of the drivers of buses, trucks and covered vans on the long routes were reckless.When a long-route bus driver decides to overtake another bus the two bus drivers compete with each  other and cause accidents like head-on collision, falling in roadside ditches or hitting roadside trees, he explained.‘From time to time we see that the government gives the transport workers time to update their licences but they don’t show interest to do that,’ he continued.Mizanur Rahman said that the drivers had to be brought under regular counselling and training so that they took to safe driving while the authorities, the owners and the road safety campaigners should take such initiatives.About the latest deadline, he urged the authorities, the owners and the workers to use this opportunity properly to improve the overall situation on the roads.Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh secretary-general Mozammel Haque Chowdhury said that due to lack of service lanes along with highways big vehicles clashed with small ones and caused fatal accidents.He also said that drivers often ignored the opportunity to update their licences while the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority also lacked capacity to issue so many licences in such a small time.According to the police report, 1,329 drivers were absconding and 481 were arrested while 1,760 vehicles were seized in 2,174 road accidents in the first seven months of this year,.Police filed first information report in 1,990 cases and general diary in 184 cases, out of which 70 cases are under trial and 1,846 under investigation.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/92193/heavy-vehicles-blamed-for-most-fatal-accidents

New Age BD,"Nov 19,2019",Promises and challenges,"Nearly 55 people on an average, according to a recent study, die in road accidents every day in Bangladesh. This is indeed a very alarming figure to reckon with. It cannot go on unchecked. There are many reasons for road accidents. Unfit vehicles, unauthorised or fake driving license, defective roads, reckless driving are some of them worth mentioning. Whatever may be the reasons, casualty of such unbelievable magnitude due to road accidents is not acceptable. It must be drastically reduced, if not totally eliminated.The whole transport sector of the country is in chaos. The road transport sector is the worse. It is time some drastic measures were taken to ensure people’s safety on road. The parliament passed an act in September 2018 named Road Transport Act 2018 replacing Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1983 in order to bring discipline in the sector.Enforcement of the law had to be delayed for more than a year in order to frame rules and regulations of the new law. Finally, the law came into force with effect on November 17 although there is still a number of issues to be addressed before full implementation of the law.Road transport and bridges minister has now to say that the new law is already in force but he has asked the law enforcement agencies to go lenient until people become fully aware of the new law. He is right. People need to be fully aware of the new law. The earlier the people get conversant with the new rules and regulations, the better it will be for their own safety.The safety rules and regulations under the newly enacted Road Transport Act 2018 keeping provisions for much higher fines and punishment including imprisonment have received mixed reactions from different quarters. While they do not deny the necessity of stringent laws to ensure safety on the roads, many of them consider these rules too harsh, in some cases disproportionate, to accept without reservation. The hefty amount of fines ranging from minimum Tk 5,000 to Tk 25,000 plus or imprisonment for violation of traffic rules or both are viewed by many to be incompatible with the defaulter’s capacity to pay if the overall per capita income of the country is taken into consideration.When somebody in talk show tries to justify the hike citing example of Singaporeans having to pay a fine as high as S$500 for similar offence, he forgets to mention that per capita income of Singapore is much higher than that of Bangladesh. The laws got to be rational and practicable.Some think that provisions for punishment as harsh as envisaged in the new law may lead to steep rise in corruption which is already rampant in the transport sector. Such apprehensions cannot be totally ruled out. As per the new law, a vehicle driver has to pay a fine of Tk 5,000 for wrong parking. The operator can justifiably ask where he is going to park his vehicle. Are their enough parking facilities in the cities’ shopping malls or markets? The answer is a big no. Road transport authorities got to find an answer to this question before going for full implementation of the law.Having discussed all the positive and negative aspects of the new rules and regulations related to road safety, we must admit that stringent law was necessary to deter what was happening in the road transport sector. We must welcome the initiative taken by the government in this respect. How can a civilised society keep their eyes closed to death of so many people on the streets from road accidents mostly for no fault of theirs? What may be required is amendment of some of the rules in the light of comments and views put forward from different quarters.The traffic signal system of Dhaka, with a population of more than 16 million, is reported to have been introduced by foreign experts. It is believed to be a very sophisticated one. The system is not in function in most of the city areas. The traffic constables are still controlling the traffic flow by raising arms or using sticks at many places. The traffic management of the city, nay all the big cities of the country, is poor, to put it politely.It is high time the authorities concerned took a serious look into the whole affair in its true perspective and ensured safety of passengers. Hussain Imam is a retired merchant navy officer.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/90999/promises-and-challenges

New Age BD,"Oct 23,2019",A worrying road regime issue largely left neglected in Bangladesh,"While the increase in both the cases started showing signs in 2017, experts believe that the increase in the share of motorcycles, largely in Dhaka, is because of the government’s allowing ride-sharing services, introduced in the capital in 2016, as many unskilled and unprofessional riders started getting into ride-sharing services. As for increase in the share of three-wheelers, mainly on highways, the reason is put down on the government’s ineffective enforcement of the ban, ordered on August 1, 2015, on three-wheelers and non-motorised vehicles from running on national highways. All this suggests that the government has failed to adequately attend to issues of road accidents not only as a whole, but also part of the problems which involves motorcycles and three-wheelers. National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation records also corroborate the situation, with the number of people having been wounded in motorcycle accidents going up to 20–25 per cent now compared with 15–20 per cent three to four years ago. While the Accident Research Institute says, based on newspaper reports, that 4,076 died and 8,715 became wounded in 3,513 accidents in 2018, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority data show, based on the first information reports, that 2,635 people died and 1,920 became wounded in 2,609 accidents that year.The government must, therefore, shore up some issues such as laying out service and feeder roads and an arrangement for alternative mode of public transports to effectively keep slow-moving vehicles off national highways, which are meant for fast-moving, heavy vehicles. And the government must attend to the issues of road regime such as the training of, generally, all motorcycle riders across the country and, especially, for motorcyclists who offer ride-sharing services in Dhaka.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/88459/a-worrying-road-regime-issue-largely-left-neglected-in-bangladesh

New Age BD,"Oct 22,2019"," Motorbikes, 3-wheelers multiply Bangladesh road accidents ","The involvement of motorcycles and three-wheeler vehicles in fatal road accidents is increasing in the capital and across the country respectively in recent years, said experts.As a result the number of deaths from both kinds of accidents is on the rise while motorbike accidents have  maimed a large number of victims, statistics show. Overall, the numbers of fatal accidents and the resultant casualties are also rising.Lack of public transports, infrastructure, skilled and professional drivers, proper planning and awareness among people has contributed to the situation, experts said.Against this backdrop, the National Road Safety Day 2019 is going to be observed today across the country for the third time.The theme of the day this year is: Livelihood is not before life, no more road accidents.Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to join a discussion organised by the road transport and bridges ministry on the day at the Krishibid Institution auditorium in the capital in the morning.The ministry is also scheduled to hold a rally, show awareness videos at bus terminals, distribute leaflets and posters among road users in all districts, including in the capital. The number of fatal accidents involving motorbikes, particularly in the capital, is increasing due to ridesharing services, experts also said.On the other hand, the number of fatal accidents involving three-wheeler vehicles is increasing in rural areas as these run on highways side by side with speedy, bigger and stronger vehicles.Road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader on different occasions said that motorcycles became a ‘terror’ in the capital and the number of fatalities were increasing on highways due to increasing presence of three wheelers.The ministry on August 1, 2015 imposed a ban on the movement of three-wheeler and non-motorised vehicles on 22 national highways but the ban was never complied with.Bangladesh Road Transport Authority data shows that 279 motorcycles were registered daily, so far, in the capital this year.  National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation director Professor Md Abdul Gani Mollah told New Age on Monday that the number of injured in motorcycle accidents in the hospital has gone up in recent years.‘Currently 20 to 25 per cent of the injured who come here are victims of motorcycle accidents, compared to 15 to 20 per cent three or four years ago,’ he said.He disclosed that legs of three to five per cent of these victims had to be amputated as the accidents badly injured their veins.According to the hospital, a total of 1.33 lakh patients came to its outpatient and emergency departments in 2018.A report by the Accident Research Institute of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology reveals that the involvement of motorbikes and three-wheelers in fatal road accidents has been going up in recent years.The report was based on reports published in newspapers.In 2016, the involvement of motorcycles and three-wheeler vehicles in road accidents was eight per cent and five per cent respectively both across the country and in the capital, which started to increase from 2017.Across the country, the year 2017  saw the involvement of motorcycles and three-wheelers in accidents increasing  to 16 per cent and 11 per cent respectively while the respective  figures for 2018 were 19 per cent and 14 per cent and till October 18 this year were 25 per cent and 13 per cent.The capital in 2017 witnessed the involvement of motorbikes and three-wheelers in road accidents rising to 15 per cent and eight per cent respectively while the respective figures for 2018 were 19 per cent and four per cent and those for this year till October 18 were 18 per cent and eight per cent.The same report shows that 3,488 people were killed and 5,863 injured in 3,131 accidents across the country till October 18 this year.The countrywide corresponding figures for 2018 were 4,076 and 8,715 in 3,513 accidents, for 2017 were 3,672 and 7,400 in 2,917 accidents and for 2016 were 2,529 were and 5,059 in 1,764 accidents.According to BRTA data, based on police’s first information reports, the year 2018 saw 2,609 traffic accidents that killed 2,635 and injured 1,920 people.In 2017, 2,513 people were killed and 1,898 injured in 2,562 accidents while the 2016 corresponding figures were 2,463 and 2,134 in 2,566 accidents and the 2015 corresponding figures 2,376 and 1,958 in 2,394 accidents, the data shows.In the first four months of this year, 427 people were killed and 658 were injured in 848 accidents in the country, it also shows.Accident Research Institute assistant professor Kazi Md Shifun Newaz said that motorcycles mainly collided with public transports and cars in Dhaka and the causalities increased as the motorbikers did not follow the traffic rules properly and wear requisite safety gears.‘In Bangladesh they only use helmets, most of which are of low quality, while in other countries they have to wear special dresses, gloves and bands,’ he mentioned.Shifun Newaz said that after the introduction of ridesharing services in the capital in 2016 many unskilled and unprofessional motorcyclists from districts came here, who were unaware about the traffic situation in the capital.They neither have professional training nor follow traffic rules, causing fatal accidents, he went on.The accident researcher said that due to absence of service lanes and alternative transports slow-moving vehicles ran on highways and accidents occurred.The authorities should introduce buses on highways for small distances to keep slow-moving vehicles off such roads.In a statement on Monday the Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh said that 29,315 people were killed and 69,428 injured in 21,386 road accidents between 2015 and 2018.These accidents involved 18.33 per cent motorcycles, 14.25 per cent auto rickshaws, 9.18 per cent battery-powered rickshaws and 8.83 per cent Nasimon, Karimon and tractors.PWAB secretary-general Mozammel Haque Chowdhury said that the overall numbers of fatal accidents and causalities were increasing in the country due to increasing presence of smaller vehicles.The transportation system should mainly be based on buses but importance was given to smaller vehicles creating the current situation, he said.He also said that unskilled drivers engaged in ridesharing services were also a major reason behind road

Cantonment College students in an accident because of reckless driving at Kurmitola in Dhaka on July 29, 2018.Most of the demands for road safety, made by the students who had held protests for more than a week across the country, remain unimplemented despite positive assurances from the authorities.The authorities, however, have claimed that the situation has improved following different initiatives taken by the government in last one year.On the other hand, road safety experts have asserted that the situation on roads has deteriorated as the number of fatal accidents increased over the period and nothing worth mentioning has been achieved.Many directives were issued and recommendations made but there were no significant and visible initiatives to implement them, they added.Thousands of students took to streets after their two fellows were killed when a reckless driver drove a Jabal-e-Noor company bus off the road and ploughed through a crowd while competing with another bus of the same company.Amid an utter anarchy in the road sector for long, the students demanded highest punishment for the bus drivers responsible for the killing of the two, establishing footbridges and taking safety measures for safe movement of students, establishing speed-breakers in accident-prone areas including in front of the schools and colleges.They also demanded taking all responsibilities by the government of the families of the deceased and injured, compelling the buses to carry students, half fare for the students, not allowing buses without fitness and driving by any unlicensed driver at any place of the country and ban on carrying passengers by public transports in excess of their capacity.The prime minister on June 25, 2018 gave directives to ensure drivers’ rest every five hours, to employ alternate drivers for long-distance vehicles, training and resting facilities for drivers and their assistants, use of seatbelts while travelling, and abiding by the traffic signals.Most of these demands and directives still remain on paper.Meanwhile, a Dhaka court began the trial of two owners, two drivers and two assistants of Jabal-e-Noor in July this year and the next date of the case is August 22 for the testimony by the Investigation Officer.In another development, the High Court on Wednesday last asked the owners of 4.79 lakh unfit vehicles running across the country to get fitness certificates for the vehicles from the Bangladesh Road Transports Authority within two months.Earlier on April 28, a committee headed by former shipping minister and influential transport sector workers-owners leader Shajahan Khan submitted as many as111 recommendations to prime minister Sheikh Hasina to bring back order on the roads and reduce the number of road accidents.According to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, in June this year, across the country, 40.57 lakh registered motor vehicles were run by around 22 lakh drivers with valid licences.The transport operators, therefore, have to struggle to get alternate drivers, and the long-route drivers are yet to get the proposed resting places.Meanwhile, the number of deaths on roads has increased as violation of traffic rules by all sections of people continued across the country, including reckless driving, overtaking, overloading and operation of unfit vehicles.The lack of public transports and facilities for commuters has exacerbated the problem.The government on September 20 last year passed the Road Transport Act, 2018 in the wake of the student agitation for road safety, which is yet to be implemented.Since July last year, the police have observed a countrywide traffic week and the Dhaka Metropolitan Police traffic months and weeks.Within seven months of their countrywide movement for safe roads, students restarted agitating after a Suprabhat Pvt Ltd bus ran over a Bangladesh University of Professionals student on the Pragati Sarani at Badda in the capital on March 19, 2019.Besides, as showed by police statistics prepared based on first information reports, yearly fatalities in road accidents increased in Bangladesh in 2018.According to the statistics, 2018 saw 2,635 people killed and 1,920 injured in 2,609 traffic accidents, the previous year 2,513 killed and 1,898 injured in 2,562 accidents, while the year before witnessed 2,463 killed and 2,134 injured in 2,566 accidents.In the first four months of the current year, 427 people were killed and 658 injured in 848 accidents across the country, the police data shows.According to Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology’s Accident Research Institute, which compiles statistics on road accidents from newspaper reports, 2,408 people were killed and 3,947 injured in 2,177 accidents up to July 20 this year.Road Transport and Highways Division secretary Md Nazrul Islam told New Age on Sunday that in recent years the number of vehicles had increased on the roads under the Local Government Engineering Department and the Roads and Highways Department.‘If we analyse the number of increased vehicles, new roads and accidents then we will find that the road safety situation has improved in recent times,’ he said.BRTA chairman Md Moshiar Rahman said that they had taken many initiatives including holding awareness programmes, publishing advertisements and operation of mobile courts.He claimed that the rate of accidents had gone down though the number was still high as passenger-laden three-wheeler vehicles still got on highways illegally, causing fatal accidents.Professor M Anwar Hossian, who headed a nine-member expert sub-committee on road safety in 2011, told this daily that he did not see any big change in the road safety situation in last one year.He pointed out that Obaidul Quader, the road transport and bridges minister, was simultaneously working as the general secretary of Bangladesh Awami League, who also got sick this year for a considerable period of time.This ministry should have a full-time strong leadership as it was not possible on Obaidul’s part to give much time to the road sector, he said, adding, ‘The government lacks commitment to improving the situation.’Accident Research Institute director Professor Mizanur Rahman said that considering the data the situation had deteriorated as the number of fatal accidents increased this year.He also said that though many directives were issued and recommendations made (with regard to road safety) there was no visible initiative to implement them.Besides making people aware, the authorities should increase the number of facilities like public transports and enhance the road network to improve the situation, he added.The Passenger Welfare Association of Bangladesh in a statement on Sunday demanded immediate implementation of the students’ demands.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/80011/road-safety-elusive-as-demands-not-met

New Age BD,"Jun 30,2019",Insurance claims in road accident cases almost absent,"Rights activists and transport system experts on Saturday alleged that insurance claims by victims in road accidents was almost absent in the country. At a roundtable discussion they also said that the state had to ensure a proper insurance system for safety on roads.They urged the authorities to make third-party insurance mandatory in the Road Transport Act, 2018. The Road Safety Foundation organised the discussion at the National Press Club in the capital on compensation for road accident victims, need for road safety insurance and for a separate road safety fund.While presenting the keynote paper, Professor Moazzem Hossain, former director, Accident Research Institute, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said that claiming of insurance in road accidents were almost absent and no statistics were available on the number of these cases.Pointing out that as per the existing law the family of a dead victim gets Tk 20,000, an injured victim Tk 5,000–Tk 10,000, and Tk 50,000 was given for property damaged under the third-party insurance, he viewed the compensations as very insufficient.The professor proposed a one-time government grant, a fund from registration and road tax sectors as well as insurance of vehicles and fuel consumption without imposing more tax on people.He said that financial transparency and accountability were essential in maintaining the taxes collected from registration of vehicles, fitness checking, road tax sectors and fines realised by the police. The foundation’s legal economist and vice-president MS Siddiqui also presented a paper where he said that currently three types of insurance were available in the country – comprehensive, minimum risk and third-party.A third-party insurance obtained by an insured vehicle (first party) from an insurance company (second party) for protection against the claims of accident victims (third party) and the legal liability of the driver were mandatory according to the existing Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983.‘But these provisions have been made optional at the newly enacted Road Transport Act, 2018,’ he noted, urging the government to make this insurance mandatory in the new law.Former National Human Rights Commission chairman Professor Md Mizanur Rahman said that the state had to take the responsibility of the accident victims to facilitate their immediate treatment and compensation while the transport owners also could not avoid their responsibility.He also blamed influence of businesspeople, corruption and absence of the rule of law for the situation and urged the government to ensure appropriate compensation for the victims.Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation general secretary Osman Ali alleged that the insurance procedure in the country was very lengthy and the insurance companies should be held more responsible in cases of compensation.Bangladesh Bus and Truck Owners Association chairman Ramesh Chandra Ghosh said that the issues of insurance should be brought under greater monitoring.The discussion was attended, among others, by foundation chairman Professor AI Mahbub Uddin Ahmed and executive director Saidur Rahman and Prime Insurance Company Limited managing director Mohammadi Khanam.  More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/77012/insurance-claims-in-road-accident-cases-almost-absent

New Age BD,"Jun 20,2019"," Drivers must be tested for drugs, eyesight: HC ","The High Court Division on Thursday ruled that drivers must be tested for drugs and eyesight before getting driving licence and while driving.The bench of Justice JBM Hassan and Justice Md Khairul Alam asked the government, the Bangladesh Road Transports Authority and the police to introduce a system in six months for carrying out the tests to check road accidents.The issued seven-point directives for road safety in a verdict in a public interest litigation writ petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Ruhul Quddus Kajol demanding Tk 1 crore in compensation for killing Govt Titumir College student Rajib Hasan in road accident in April 2018. The bench directed the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation chairman and the directors of Sajan Bus Company to jointly pay Tk 50 lakh as compensation to Rajib’s two orphan brothers in two months.BRTC lawyer Munirujjaman told reporters that the corporation would appeal against the directive on it.Rajib, a student of Govt Titumir College, died at a hospital on April 17 after his right forearm was severed as a Sajan Paribahan Bus, in a bid to overtake, dashed a BRTC Double-decker he was on board, in Karwan Bazar crossing on April 3, 2018.The court also directed the home ministry to pay Tk 1 lakh to the three-member expert committee comprising two Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology professors and Nirapad Sarak Chai chairman Ilias Kanchan for submitting to the court the report on a through probe into Rajib’s accident and recommending measures to prevent road accidents.On May 8, 2018, after hearing the writ petition, the High Court asked Swajan Pariibahan and BRTC to jointly pay Tk 1 crore to Rajib’s family.The family are yet to get the compensation as the Appellate Division in November 2018 stayed the High Court order and asked the High Court Division to dispose of the writ petition after assessing the responsibility for the road accident.In the verdict, the court also asked the respondents to install close-circuit cameras at major bus stops in the capital in six months to determine speed of buses.The court also asked the respondents to introduce in six months the system of bus route rationalisation for running buses in different colours on different routes.The court also asked the respondents to enforce the Road Transport Act 2018 by assigning a date in official gazette for its enforcement in six months.The respondents were asked to immediately implement three other directives — prohibiting blowing horns near hospitals, educational institutions and in residential areas, keeping doors of running buses closed and picking no passengers except from bus stops and ensuring that driver must be tested for drugs and eyesight while examining their licenses.On February 16, 2019, New Age ran a report stating that drug addiction among drivers of public and private transports had long since remained overlooked in from the process of obtaining licence to driving on roads as there was no system in place to check it in the country.The report quoted Accident Research Institute assistant professor Kazi Md Shifun Newaz of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology as saying that transport workers usually used drugs like hemp and Yaba which helped them to remain awake for a long time. ‘These drugs reduce their capacity to take right decisions and they take more risky turns or overtake due to over confidence,’ he explained. In many countries, apart from blood, urine, saliva and hair tests, police use some machines to check drugs level in bloods within 10 minutes, he mentioned. He said that the law enforcing agencies or the Accident Research Institute had no machines to check drug addiction among on-duty drivers while the licence providing authorities should play a strong role in this regard. ‘As a result we don’t know how many accidents are caused by addicted drivers. But it is obviously a big reason behind road accidents,’ he added. Experts and anti-drug campaigners demanded that the authorities should develop a system from licensing to enforcement to detect if any driver was running on drugs, which is being followed in other countries like the United Kingdom and Canada.They blamed drugs for a large number of fatal accidents. Currently, Bangladesh Road Transport Authority only conducts a medical test of the professional drivers which, however, does not include any tests for drugs. Highway police and traffic department of Dhaka Metropolitan Police have no system to detect drug level in the blood of drivers on duty.According to the existing Motor Vehicles Ordinance 1983, the professional drivers have to submit a medical certificate to obtain licence.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/75967/drivers-must-be-tested-for-drugs-eyesight-hc

This means about 2,500 people died every year on an average in road accidents. But the minister could not say how many cases were filed in this regard. He mentioned technical glitches of vehicles, over-speeding, overtaking and overloading as reasons for accidents and held inefficient drivers responsible. But admission that such a huge number of accidents took place will not resolve the issues. Most of the traffic-related directives have remained unheeded for years, causing many of these accidents. Regular traffic offences, conducted by almost each and everyone, are what have become commonplace almost everywhere. Unfit, modified and rickety buses still dominate the traffic although the High Court in August 2015 asked the authorities to keep all unfit vehicles off the road. A nexus is said to have developed between some government officials and transport operators that has allowed unfit vehicles to be run by unskilled drivers with a culture of impunity. Such disregard for traffic rules has resulted from the fact that a section of traffic officials are indifferent to violation of rules, which is unacceptable. Without considering the solutions which would include bus route franchise and the appointment of trained drivers, road safety cannot be ensured. The minister must be aware that road safety still remains elusive as a uniform traffic management and disciplined public transport system still remain mostly on papers even after the issue was one of the most discussed in 2018.All the authorities concerned mus realise that the enforcement of rules is a requisite for order in traffic that can ensure the safety of passengers and pedestrians alike.

He sold Ayesha at a brothel in Narayanganj after promising to take her to a relative’s house. After staying in the brothel, she was convinced that she had no way to go out of there. In the brothel, some people guarded her round-the-clock so that she could not flee.One day, police demolished the brothel and then hundreds of women like Ayesha came to the streets. Later, they started working in various hotels as sex workers through middlemen. After passing the days in this way till the age of 27, Ayesha joined an HIV/AIDS service centre in cooperation with a local NGO.She is now working in the centre to make the female sex workers aware of the HIV/AIDS.According to the government data, an AIDS patient was first detected in the country in 1989 and so far 6,455 such patients have been identified.As many as 1,022 people so far died of AIDS and the estimated number of the people infected by HIV is 13,000. However, all of them could not be detected.Till August last year, the government has provided antiretroviral therapy to 3,265 people.Mainly male and female sex workers, the transgender community and those who inject drugs in vein are considered vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Some government and non-government organisations are working shoulder to shoulder with the AIDS patients and those vulnerable to the deadly disease.According to a survey conducted by the government in 2015-2016, the number of sex workers in the country was 1, 02,260 and the number of the people who take drugs through needle and syringe was 33,067.Alongside the government, some NGOs are also delivering services to these sex workers and drug addicts.Ayesha said when she first got involved in this profession she did not know what condom was. Though many males use condoms, the numbers of males who use it do not want to use, she said.‘I didn’t create any pressure for using condoms as I could not understand whatever risk I was in,’ she said.She continued saying, ‘Though I was not infected by HIV/AIDS, I suffered from many sexual diseases. I’m now doing fine after receiving treatment for a long time.’Ayesha said she is now continuing to work on making the female sex workers aware so that they compel the males to use condom during sex.‘I think that many males have now become aware about using condoms,’ she said.Ayesha thinks side by side with the government, the non-government organisations have to come forward further to this end.‘If we become conscious from our respective positions, various sexual diseases including HIV/AIDS will be reduced to a great extent,’ she said.Rahela Khatun is working with Ayesha. Though she is not a sex worker by profession, she feels the pain and sorrow of the sex workers.She said almost all of the sex workers are suffering from various sexual diseases and its main reason is not using condoms.Rahela, however, said the number of people using condoms is increasing day by day.She said many males do not want to use condoms, and as a result, she thinks, the risk of infecting by sexual diseases still exists.While visiting Proyash, an organisation providing services to the drug addicts, near Bashabo Balur Math in the city, it was seen that some drug addicts are receiving services from there.Of them, the 29-year-old Matin (not real name) infected by HIV positive said he is taking drugs from the age of 21.Though he first consumed cannabis and phensidyl syrup, he later started taking drugs in vein at the encouragement of his friends.‘There were such days that me and some of my friends took drugs through the same syringe and I’m now infected by HIV,’ he said.Amin, who is giving services at the centre, said the number of people injecting drugs in veins is rising day by day. In this case, the number of females is not less.‘Currently 40 drug addicts are taking services from our centre and 17 of them are females. And of the 17 people, nine took drugs in veins,’ Amin added.He thinks the government should be tougher in this regard and the non-government organisations should extend more cooperation.More about:",https://www.newagebd.net/article/74626/ngos-should-extend-more-cooperation-to-combat-drug-addiction
