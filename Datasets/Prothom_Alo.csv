2021-01-16,,"19 Jan 2021, 04:48",,Dhaka,,26.0,,,35pc of accidents are on motorbikes,"There were 26 patients, injured in road accidents, in the corridor in front of the operating theatre of the National Orthopaedic Hospital and Rehabilitation Institute (Pangu Hospital) in the capital city last Saturday. Of these patients, 12 were injured in motorbike accidents. The hospital authorities say that a large percentage of the road injury cases are the victims of motorbike accidents nowadays. Persons researching on road accidents said that motorbike accidents are mainly caused by reckless speeding, attempts to overtake, repeated lane changes, violation of traffic rules and talking on the mobile phone while on the move. The number of deaths is also increasing due to low quality helmets or not wearing helmets at all. Pedestrians also fall victim to accidents due to reckless speed of motorbikes. Shamsul Alam, a member of the General Economics Department of the Planning Commission, was such a victim. He had an accident last Saturday evening while walking in the Crescent Lake area next to the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. He told Prothom Alo that he was hit by a speeding motorcycle while crossing the road. His right leg was broken in the accident. At Pangu hospital The National Orthopaedic Hospital and Rehabilitation Institute, better known as Pangu hospital, is the largest institute in the country for the treatment of fractured bones. Its official name is name is National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedic Rehabilitation (NITOR). Inquiries at the hospital's emergency department revealed that 34 people have received treatment after being injured in road accidents till 1 pm on Saturday. Among them, 16 were the victims of motorcycle accidents. Some were driving the bikes, some were passengers riding pillion and some were pedestrians. According to the five registrar books of the emergency department, 2484 people received treatment at the hospital in the first 16 days of the new year. Of them, 585 were victims of road accidents. There is no mention of how many of them were the victims of motorbike accidents. However, Prof Abdul Gani Mollah, director of NITOR, told Prothom Alo that 35 per cent of the road accidents cases at NITOR are victims of motorcycle accidents. He said most of the patients come from outside the capital. In recent times, the number of people injured in motorcycle accidents while sharing rides is also increasing. University student Naimul Islam went to NITOR on Sunday with a fractured his arm. He frankly admitted that he had the accident due to over speeding while riding with a friend. He told Prothom Alo that his motorcycle was over-speeding and control on the sand on the road. Even the general motorcycle drivers are worried about reckless driving. Md Nayeem Hasan, who works for a private firm, returns his home to Mirpur from his office in Banani every night. He said that motorbikes and cars race each other. This has become a major cause of fear for the ordinary motorcyclists. How many vehicles, how many accidents? According to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), the number of registered motorcycles in the country is more than 3.1 million, which is 68 per cent of the total vehicles. There are about 800,000 registered motorcycles in Dhaka alone. Outside of that a large part of the motorcycles are unregistered. According to the marketing companies, about 500,000 new motorcycles are sold in the country every year. The Accident Research Institute (ARI) of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology and the organisation for the advocacy of safe roads Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa) compile reports of accidents published in the media every year. According to Nishcha, there were 3232 road accidents in the country in 2020, of which 1,127 were motorcycle accidents. Of these, 29 per cent involved truck accidents and 22 per cent bus accidents. According to BUET's ARI, 336 people died in 288 motorcycle accidents in 2016. In 2020, the number of accidents raised to 1,008 and 1,097 people died in these accidents. A 2007 study by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that wearing a good quality helmet reduces the risk of serious injury in a motorcycle accident by 70 per cent. And the risk of death is reduced by 40 percent. Regarding the trend of not wearing a helmets outside the big cities, the Assistant Inspector General of Police (Media and Public Relations), Sohail Rana, said that action is being taken in accordance to the law for not wearing helmets. Various awareness programmes are also being arranged. Ride sharing has increased In Dhaka, motorbike ride sharing has increased exponentially in the last few years. Many people who are not even registered with ride-sharing companies, also carry passengers on their motorcycles. ARI conducted a survey of the riders and passengers of 450 ride sharing motorcycles in 2020. It revealed that 50 per cent of the passengers suffer from insecurity regarding the driving. According to another survey conducted by the same organisation, 30 per cent of the drivers wear very low quality helmets. In only 2 per cent of the cases, riders are given ‘full face’ helmets. According to ARI's observation, the competition of ride-sharing motorcycle riders and the tendency to race ahead are the main causes of accidents. On Sunday, Prothom Alo sent e-mails to the authorities of three ride sharing apps asking the number of accidents of their vehicles. Uber did not disclose the number of accidents, but answered the question. They said they pay Tk 200,000 for death and permanent disability in an accident and a maximum of Tk 100,000 for hospitalisation. Uber said they encourage the use of the best quality helmets. Pathao (ride sharing app) did not reply to the e-mail. However, Maliha Malek, the managing director of Shohoj dot com, told Prothom Alo over mobile phone that they did not have any reports of the their ride-sharing app bikes having any accident. What are the riders and sellers saying? A review by a multinational motorbike marketing company has revealed that overtaking is one of the major causes of motorcycle accidents. Apart from this, fatigue and rushing are also the main reasons for the accidents. Reckless driving of buses, trucks, ‘human hauler’ passenger vehicles and cars , sudden lane changes, sudden turning and lane changing of non-motorised vehicles, sudden potholes in the road, high or low covers of manholes, unmarked speed breakers, carelessness of pedestrians and sudden movement of animals on the road are also some big reasons behind road accidents. For example, Akash Iqbal (26) and his wife Maya Hazarika (25) were killed when a bus of Ajmeri Paribahan hit them on Airport Toad in the capital yesterday. Top two executives of the two companies told Prothom Alo that sales of the motorcycles as personal vehicles are increasing in developing countries. Motorcycle sales will also increase in Bangladesh like Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and India. Public-private initiatives are needed to reduce the number of accidents. They also said that there is no effective system of training the motorcyclists in the country. Awareness and training initiatives should be taken in combination with the private sector. People should be encouraged to buy high-tech motorcycles with a good security systems. Shah Mohammad Ashiqur Rahman, the chief financial officer of Honda Bangladesh Limited, said the number of accidents had increased in Japan once. Later they reduced it with various measures. He said Honda provides the driving license on behalf of the governments in many countries. They are also providing training in Bangladesh. Plastic bowls in the name of helmets Sajjadul Bari, Director (Standards) of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI), told Prothom Alo yesterday that BSTI does not have the facility to check the quality of helmets at present. However, all the helmets sold in the market are supposed to be manufactured and imported as per the standards prescribed by the BSTI. Due to the lack of surveillance by BSTI, one portion of the helmets sold in the market is basically just plastic bowls. Regarding the overall scenario, ARI’s director Hadiuzzaman told Prothom Alo that ensuring good quality helmets for both the bikers and the riders, reducing the competition among the drivers of ride sharing apps, raising awareness and strictly enforcing traffic laws can reduce motorcycle accidents.","19 Jan 2021, 04:48",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/accident/35-of-accidents-are-on-motorbikes

2019-09-06,10:00,"04 Jul 2019, 04:28",,Noakhali,,1.0,Motorcycle,Motorcycle,Accidents kill 12 people per hour in Bangladesh,"Paban Majumder is disabled. He met with a road accident and underwent surgery on 30 June at the capital city’s National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (commonly known as ‘pangu hospital’), where his right leg was removed from above the knee. Paban’s younger brother Madhab Majumder is looking after him. Madhab told Prothom Alo that around 10 in the morning of 9 June, Paban had been going to the market by motorbike in Hatia, Noakhali. He was hit by an ‘easy bike’ and was seriously injured. His right leg was broken. He was rushed to the Hatia upazila hospital and then later brought to a private hospital in Dhaka. He was finally brought to the government orthopaedic hospital. Madhab said he himself had been badly injured when he fell off a coconut tree a few years ago. His left arm was broken. They spent a lot on treatment but his arm is still crooked. He said even his two other brothers had met with accidents. One brother lost an eye in while operating a machine in a factory in Dhamrai in 2000. Another brother committed suicide in 2007. This family from south Hatia seems to reflect the state of accidents in Bangladesh. According to the last national survey on accidents brought out in 2016, it was revealed that 12 persons died in accidents and injuries per hour in Bangladesh. Every hour 2287 persons were injured. And among those seriously injured, every hour 28 were rendered disabled. The report, ‘Bangladesh Health and Accident Survey 2016’, was prepared by the health ministry’s non-infectious disease control programme and the non-government Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh (CIPRB). A summary of the report was published, but not the entire report. Prothom Alo recently managed to get a copy of the full report. Head of the CIPRB data management unit Md Abu Taleb, speaking to Prothom Alo, said, “Accidents, injuries or wounds are a serious public health problem. These have a deep impact on a family, the society and the state. The public only comes to know of a very small percentage of the accidents including road accidents, suicide and drowning. The actually picture is much worse and alarming.” The World Health Organisation lists 13 categories of accidents and injuries. These are suicide, road accidents, falling down, being cut with sharp implements, being injured by a falling object, bitten by an animal or insect, violence, drowning, injury from a machine or equipment, electric shock, accidental suffocation and accidental intake of poison. The survey collected information on all these issues. In the survey, 299,216 persons of 70,000 families in towns and villages of 16 districts of the country were interviewed. The survey covered the period from March to June 2016. They survey stated that every year over 108,000 died of various accidents. Of these, 45,000 were children under 18 years of age. The main causes of accidental death among all age groups were suicide, road accidents, drowning and falling. Suicide was more common among women. Meanwhile, over 20 million people are injured in accidents every year, of which 242,000 result in permanent disability. Endless parade of deaths According to the survey, around 109,000 people die of various accidents and injuries every year in the country. That means, 298 die every day or, 12 every hour. The elderly mostly die by falling down. The survey report says that every year over 45,000 children under 18 years of age die in the country, that means, 125 in a day. And 37 per cent of this age group die of drowning. Other main causes of death in this group are suicide, road accidents and electrification. Among adults dying in accidents, the main causes are suicide, road accidents and falling down. Every day 170 persons die of these three reasons. A similar survey was run in 2003. A comparison of the two surveys shows that in the case of under-18's, accidental deaths have increased other than in the case of drowning and animal bites. In 2003, every day there were 83 deaths. This is now 125. Deaths due to suicide, road accidents, electricity and falling, have increased. Information on injuries remain concealed Md Abu Taleb of CIPRB collected and analysed information in 2005 on accidents and injuries. He told Prothom Alo, “ Every day, every hour, somewhere in the country someone is in an accident. Sometimes it is because of one’s own fault, sometimes due to others’. Only a few of these incidents actually come to light.” The survey took into consideration the accidents or injuries for which a person had to take medical treatment or had to abstain from attending school or work. That reveals that over 20 million persons are injured in a year, that is, 2287 persons are injured on the roads, outdoors, at home and at the work place every hour. The most people are injured by falling. They fall from trees and high buildings, slip and fall on the streets, from buses, trains and rickshaws. They have to be treated for their injuries and their everyday life is disrupted. Every day over 16,000 people are injured in this manner. There has been no national level discussion on this issue. Road accidents have been discussed in recent times, but not all road accidents reach the media. The road accidents which make news are normally about accidents involving many persons being injured at one time or many persons of the same family being hurt or if a child or a student is injured. However, many more persons are injured in accidents but these incidents remain unknown. Over 3.4 million people are injured in accidents every year, that is, over 9000 a day. More people are injured by sharp implements than in road accidents. Around 12,500 persons are injured everyday by knives, cleavers, scythes, spades, shovels, blades and other sharp implements. That means over 4.5 million are injured in this manner every year. While a huge number of people receive injuries, 91.9 per cent of these accidents are of medium degree where they are treated for their injuries and released or miss just one day from school or work. Serious accidents constitute 5.4 per cent of the mishaps where the victims stay for 10 or less days at hospital, but do not require surgery. And 1.4 per cent of the people are seriously injured in accidents and are rendered permanently disabled. 661 disabled per day Every year 241,000 people become disabled due to accidents or injuries. That means 661 are disabled per day. The most injuries are occurred by falling from heights. For about four decades now, the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (CRP) has been providing treatment and rehabilitation services for the paralysed. CRP executive director Md Shafiqul Islam told Prothom Alo, “Most of the patients who come here were paralysed after receiving serious injuries of the spine or back. According to our records, 40 per cent of the patients are injured when falling from heights. These include high trees, buildings, bridges and so on. Many patients come in the summer months when they fall from mango, lychee and jackfruit trees.” These people fall and are paralysed. Around 83,000 people are disabled in this manner. The next cause of disability is road accidents, with over 80,000 disabled in this manner every year. Consequences and the way ahead While presenting a research study on 26 May at the government’s planning division, Md Abu Taleb said, “Accidents have a deep impact on the family, close relatives and the society. Most parents speak of their children’s studies being hampered because of accidents.” Speaking to Prothom Alo, he said, when the only earning member of a family dies in an accident, the family become helpless. The children’s studies come to a halt. They may have dreamt of becoming a doctor, engineer, joining the police or anything, but they simply end up as child workers. The research findings are very similar with that of the survey conducted by the health ministry’s non-infectious disease control programme. This study on the impact and consequences of accidents was funded by the social science research council of the government’s planning division. Deputy secretary of the planning division Uttam Kumar Das told Prothom Alo, “I had no idea that the problems caused by accidents were so big, so serious. We will send the results of this study to various ministries. The data will also be used in drawing up national policies.” The survey report had several recommendations. It was said that accidents would have to be included on the priority list of the health sector and a national accident strategic paper would have to be prepared and implemented. Also, experiences of any positive initiatives to prevent accidents should also be shared. CIPRB and icddr,b have jointly been running a project called Anchal since 2006, aimed at preventing drowning in water. The project is being implemented in 10 upazilas of 7 districts. Executive director of CIPRB Fazlul Huq told Prothom Alo, “Child deaths due to drowning have fallen by 50 per cent in our work area. All accidents can be reduced if such effective initiatives are taken up.” * This piece appeared in the print edition of Prothom Alo and has been rewritten by Ayesha Kabir","04 Jul 2019, 04:28",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/12-people-die-in-accidents-per-hour

2019-07-28,,"28 Jul 2019, 21:12",,,,,,,Death rules Dhaka roads,"Over the last one year, 297 persons were killed in road accidents in the capital city Dhaka. And around 38 per cent of these victims were pedestrians. There is no decrease in the number of deaths due to road accidents in the city. These figures were revealed by the Accident Research Institute (ARI) of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). The ARI statistics were from 1 July 2018 to 1 July 2019. Of these deaths, 46 took place on the Airport Road alone. According to the institute’s report, 276 died of road accidents in 2017 in the city. When two students of Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College, Diya Khanam Mim and Abdul Karim Rajib, were killed in a road accident while waiting for a bus on Airport Road a year ago, angry school, college and university students broke out in protest. They took up a movement, demanding safe roads. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police and other agencies of the government at the time spoke of various initiatives to address the situation. A year has passed since the movement, but those initiatives are yet to be fulfilled. Dhaka’s roads still see no discipline. During the safe road movement, hoodlums in helmets swooped down on the protesting students and assaulted them. Journalists were injured in these attacks too. The police turned a blind eye to these attacks carried out by activists of the government-backed student organisation. Instead, they filed 60 cases against a few hundred demonstrators and sent 99 to jail, 52 of whom were students. These students are out on bail now, but still have to appear in court. The police have submitted charge sheets in two of the 60 cases. Final reports for two of the cases were submitted, recommending release from charges. The other cases remain under investigation. Jahanara Huq, the mother of an accused student Zahidul Huq, told Prothom Alo on Sunday, the police picked up her son on false charges. He was even sent to jail. He has to appear in court every month now. He is under mental stress and his studies have been affected. She has no idea when he will be released from charges. Former law minister Shafiq Ahmed has said that it is very unfortunate that the investigations in these cases have still not been completed. He told Prothom Alo that if there was no evidence or proof, the charges against the students should be dropped as soon as possible. Deaths do not decrease Upon orders of the Supreme Court, an inquiry committee had been formed to look into the deaths of the two students of Shaheed Ramiz Uddin Cantonment College. The committee, headed by the director of BUET’s ARI, Mizanur Rahman, submitted its report to the court. The report maintained that the disorder in the public transport sector was responsible for the road accidents in Dhaka. Public transport had decreased, but the number of private cars was on a steady increase. Most of the bus routes were haphazard. The bus drivers were not given proper appointments, but hired on a daily basis. The bus owners collected their money from the drivers at the end of the day. The drivers were also under a lot of pressure, having to pay for the fuel and other miscellaneous costs. Associate professor of BUET’s Accident Research Institute, Md. Saifun Newaz, speaking to Prothom Alo, said that the safe road movement is over, but Dhaka’s road accidents continue. The public transport sector is still in chaos. There is no visible progress in reducing the incidence of road accidents. Deaths on Airport Road Records indicate that the highest number of road accident deaths in Dhaka city take place on the Airport Road. Over the past four years, 204 persons have died on this treacherous road. On 11 February this year, an 18-year-old boy was killed by a bus in front of the Joarshahara bus stand. Police officer Mofakkharul filed a case with the Khilkhet police station in this regard. Police inspector (investigations) of Khilkhet police station, Abul Bashar Muhammad Asaduzzaman, told Prothom Alo that bus and motorcycle drivers drove at reckless speeds. Pedestrians mostly failed to use the over-bridges to cross the streets. That was why the road accident deaths were not decreasing. It has been observed from various records that there are 23 particular sports near the Hazrat Shah Jalal International Airport that are prone to accidents. Additional commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), Mofiz Uddin, informed Prothom Alo that there were many reasons that the deaths on Dhaka roads were not decreasing. However, he said, the police were taking all sorts of measures to reduce the number of deaths.Chairman of Nirapod Sarak Chai, actor Ilyas Kanchan, feels that the road accidents continue as the road transport act is not followed. Vehicles without fitness were plying the streets of Dhaka, he observed while talking to Prothom Alo. The drivers were driving recklessly, killing people. Order would have to be ensured in the public transport sector to reduce deaths on the roads. He called for stern application of the existing laws. * This report appeared in the print edition of Prothom Alo and has been rewritten in English by Ayesha Kabir","28 Jul 2019, 21:12",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/Death-rules-Dhaka-roads

Besides, 82,758 people were injured in these accidents, according to a report released by Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity (BJKS), a passenger welfare body, on Wednesday, marking the National Roads Safety Day on 22 October.  According to the report, 8,642 people were killed and 21,855 injured in 6,581 road accidents in 2015 alone.  In 2016, some 6,055 people were killed and 15,914 injured in 4,312 road accidents.   Besides, 7,397 people were killed and 16,193 injured in 4,979 accidents in 2,017 while 7,221 people were killed and 1,5466 were injured in 5514 accidents in 2018; and 7,855 people were killed and 13,330 injured in 5,516 accidents in 2019, the BJKS report said. However, the association claimed that many reports of road accidents are not published in newspapers. These figures show that the number of casualties in road accidents in Bangladesh is increasing due to reckless driving and dangerous overtaking, according to the report. BJKS says that the desired development of roads is not yet visible even after the enactment of the Road Transport Act-2018.  Traffic chaos, anarchy, random fare hike and harassment of passengers still remain the same as before. As a result, passenger suffering, traffic jams and road accidents are increasing day by day, the report added. Amid this chaotic situation on Bangladesh's roads, BJKS considers it inappropriate to observe the National Roads Safety Day. It said the road safety issue no longer be limited to just observing a particular day as there is a need for implementation of the election pledge of the government to ensure safe roads for people on an urgent basis.

Locals accused the highway police of turning a blind eye to the situation in exchange of bribes. Sometimes, police pretend to seize a couple of three-wheelers and file cases only to release them again in exchange of money, they alleged. Police, however, denied the charges. During a visit to the area, the UNB correspondent saw ‘Mahendra’ (locally-made battery-run three-wheelers) plying freely from Bagachara to Navaron-Satkhira intersection of Sharsha to Benapole on the Jashore-Benapole Highway. The Mahendras leave for Benapole and Bagachra every few minutes from a makeshift terminal at the Satkhira intersection. Apart from it, engine-driven three-wheelers and battery-operated vans, called locally as Nosimon and Korimon, are also plying the roads. More than a hundred illegal three-wheelers are operating on the Jhikorgachha-Laujani, Navaron-Nobinagar, Godkhali-Jhikorgachha and Beneali-Jhikorgachha routes. Accidents are taking place almost every day. Locals say the unpredictable movement of these vehicles is increasing the risk of big accidents. Some people who spoke to UNB alleged that the vehicles continue to operate by bribing the Navaron Highway Police. The monthly bribes range from Tk 450 to Tk 5,500 each. There was another allegation that a certain group take money from the drivers of these illegal vehicles letting them to use roads in the municipal area. Anisuzzaman, Administrative Officer of Jashore District Bus Owners Association, said they are facing financial loss because of the three-wheelers. “No action has been taken despite written petitions submitted to various administrative offices for stopping movement of these three-wheelers,” he said. Navaron Highway Police Outpost’s in-charge Tito Kumar Nath said they are trying their best to stop the three-wheelers from operating on the highways. “We’re also filing cases against these illegal vehicles,” he said, denying the allegations of taking bribes. Mohammad Farhad, ASP of Highway Police’s Jashore Circle, said more than 200 three-wheelers were seized in the last one month. “We’re conducting drives to get these vehicles off the highways,” he said. “Action will be taken against members of highway police if they violate the law (by accepting bribes and allowing the three-wheelers ply the highways).”","18 Sep 2019, 23:24",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/Illegal-three-wheelers-making-highways-more
