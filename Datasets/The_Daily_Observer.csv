https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=313549,Road accidents galore,"Road accidents galore Given fewer number of vehicles plying our roads during the lockdown, it was expected road accidents would come down. Even though accidents have dropped down within the capital, but the same haven't happen in our districts and highways.Last Thursday, at least 7 people were killed in separate road accidents in three districts, Brahmanbaria, Gopalganj and Munshiganj. And the apparent cause behind these accidents was poor and reckless driving. Needless to mention, sad state of many roads have only added misery to the fresh spate of accidents. According to the Road Safety Foundation (RSF), in January 2021 alone, as many as 484 people were killed and 673 injured in 427 road accidents across Bangladesh-a 25.58 percent rise year-on-year. At least 445 lives were lost in 340 road accidents in January last year.There is even a more menacing current reality, at least 468 people were killed and 507 others injured in 432 road accidents across the country in the last month amid the nationwide lockdown. Given the state of vehicles plying on our roads, the degree of sense and awareness of traffic rules of drivers, their level of proficiency, and the wanton corruption that allows untrained drivers and unfit vehicles to run the roads-it is perhaps surprising that why more accidents do not occur.The point, however, the high death rate on Bangladesh roads is also because of a chronic lack of investment in systemic, targeted, and sustained road safety programmes. Additionally, most of the accidents that occur so frequently on our roads and highways are quite avoidable. What we are witnessing under the current circumstances is that the danger in roads is fast spreading like a virus in our districts and high ways. However, The Road Safety Authority has recently drafted a new National Road Safety Action Plan for the years 2021-2024 - aiming to bring down number of fatalities and injuries resulting from road accidents by 25 percent by the year 2024 - and 50 percent by the year 2030. That said - it must be noted that this authority has already failed to deliver on its previous promises, which was to curb the number of road casualties by 50 percent by the year 2020. So far a total of 8 action plans have been drafted by the National Road Safety Council (NRSC) since 1997, but none of them have been able to reach their target. Although a new plan has been formulated, there has been no proper enquiry over why the previous ones have been so ineffective in their implementation. Unless the latest NRSC plan is rigorously enforced, death on our roads would only keep mounting.","Road accidents galore:  Given fewer number of vehicles plying our roads during the lockdown, it was expected road accidents would come down.

https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=311885,Initiative must be taken to prevent boat accident,"Initiative must be taken to prevent boat accidentWaterway is one of the popular means of communication in riverine Bangladesh. Recently a collision between a sand-carrying bulkhead and a speed boat in Madaripur killed 26 passengers. According to newspaper, there is no registration of both water vehicles. Hundreds of people die in launch accidents in Bangladesh every year. On April 4, a passenger launch sank in the Shitalakshya River after being hit by a cargo ship, killing 29 people. Often such launch accidents happen and many people lose their lives.There are various reasons behind launch accidents: overloading, incompetent drivers, mismanagement, faulty launch design, lack of supervision, corruption, political interference and negligence. Although there have been frequent launch sinking incidents in the country, we have not seen sufficient instance of punishment of the culprits. Laws to prevent launch accidents have not yet been enacted. A government ordinance of 1976 has been amended more than once but that is not enough.Launch accidents often occur due to lack of regular supervision. Earlier, the Ministry of Shipping had identified 9 reasons behind the loss of life in the launch accident on the river Buriganga and recommended 20 points to avoid such accidents in the future. These recommendations included stopping boat bathing near the Sadar Ghat, removing the ferry, mandating voice declarations, setting speed limits, lifting old-fashioned launches, stop selling extra tickets, and modernizing naval law by increasing penalties, ensuring life-saving life jackets and efficient drivers.According to government estimates, 35 per cent of Bangladesh's people travel waterways. Although launch accidents happen all the time, very little action has been taken against the culprits. According to a survey, there have been more than 400 river accidents in the last four decades and about 10,000 people have died. The main reason behind all these accidents was mismanagement. Of the hundreds of launches operating on the Dhaka-Barisal route, only 10 to 15 have licensed drivers and the rest are all inexperienced and incompetent. There are more than thirty thousand river vehicles in Bangladesh, big and small, and only 9000 of them have fitness certificates.The Department of Maritime Transport has 4/5 surveyors to test the fitness of the vessel and it is really difficult and arduous to check the fitness with this number of surveyors. In many cases the fitness of these vessels is given without inspection which is really terrifying. Most launches do not have enough modern equipment and do not have the technology they need to get bad weather news. Although GPS technology has been introduced in some launches, most launches still retain that old style and are defective.Radars are needed to avoid collisions with other launches or vessels, but launches do not have adequate radars. The law of 1976 provides for a maximum imprisonment of five years, a fine of 1 lakh taka and compensation of 5 lakh taka against the owner convicted of a launch accident. However, in most cases, the launch owners are released after paying a fine. There have been many launch accidents in the last four decades and there have been a lot of investigative committees but those investigation reports have not really come to light. A few reports of the inquiry committee have been published but no action has been taken to implement the recommendations made there.Twelve major accidents have taken place in Bangladesh in the last twenty years, killing about 1,500 people. On August 4, 2014, a launch with 250 passengers sank in river. According to a survey, 42% of launch accidents happens due to collisions on the river alone. More than 4,000 people have been killed in 570 launch accidents in 29 years, mainly due to incompetence of drivers and carelessness. Launch owners and operators behave recklessly as there is no provision for severe punishment.There have been several attempts to increase the punishment of the accused in the launch accident but that too has not seen the light. According to the survey, 42.70 per cent of accidents are due to collisions, 24.70 per cent are due to overcrowding, 23.6 per cent are due to hostile weather and 6.17 per cent are due to explosions and fires. Owners and drivers are reckless due to the lack of severe penalties. Negligence and corruption in investigations is high and this leads to frequent accidents.There is a shortage of manpower required to restore order and adequate supervision of the waterways. A large number of unfit launches are operating on the waterways at great risk and are often the victims of accidents. There is only one marine court in the country to handle the trial of naval accidents but there is also a complex of cases. There are many cargo ships without registration and fitness and sand carrier launch one of them. These sand-carrying trawlers are one of the causes of accidents. There is negligence of the officials concerned of BIWTA in this case.A launch is supposed to be run by a skilled master or driver of the prescribed grade but in most cases it is not followed. Sand and brick carrying trawlers and cargo are prohibited on the waterways at night but the rules are not followed. There is no Marine Magistrate to look after the irregular navigation of the drivers. The authorities concerned do not conduct regular mobile courts to maintain the riverways discipline.River police cannot take immediate action. None of the port officers were given the power to collect fines and punish. In the last four decades, 20,000 cases have been filed for naval accidents, but only 200 have been settled. Again there are not enough manpower and equipment that can quickly rescue people after an accident. There is no alternative to intensifying patrols for preventing launch accidents on waterways.

Most launches do not have enough modern equipment and do not have the technology they need to get bad weather news. Although GPS technology has been introduced in some launches, most launches still retain that old style and are defective.Radars are needed to avoid collisions with other launches or vessels, but launches do not have adequate radars. The law of 1976 provides for a maximum imprisonment of five years, a fine of 1 lakh taka and compensation of 5 lakh taka against the owner convicted of a launch accident. However, in most cases, the launch owners are released after paying a fine. There have been many launch accidents in the last four decades and there have been a lot of investigative committees but those investigation reports have not really come to light. A few reports of the inquiry committee have been published but no action has been taken to implement the recommendations made there.Twelve major accidents have taken place in Bangladesh in the last twenty years, killing about 1,500 people. On August 4, 2014, a launch with 250 passengers sank in river. According to a survey, 42% of launch accidents happens due to collisions on the river alone. More than 4,000 people have been killed in 570 launch accidents in 29 years, mainly due to incompetence of drivers and carelessness. Launch owners and operators behave recklessly as there is no provision for severe punishment.There have been several attempts to increase the punishment of the accused in the launch accident but that too has not seen the light. According to the survey, 42.70 per cent of accidents are due to collisions, 24.70 per cent are due to overcrowding, 23.6 per cent are due to hostile weather and 6.17 per cent are due to explosions and fires. Owners and drivers are reckless due to the lack of severe penalties. Negligence and corruption in investigations is high and this leads to frequent accidents.There is a shortage of manpower required to restore order and adequate supervision of the waterways. A large number of unfit launches are operating on the waterways at great risk and are often the victims of accidents. There is only one marine court in the country to handle the trial of naval accidents but there is also a complex of cases. There are many cargo ships without registration and fitness and sand carrier launch one of them. These sand-carrying trawlers are one of the causes of accidents. There is negligence of the officials concerned of BIWTA in this case.A launch is supposed to be run by a skilled master or driver of the prescribed grade but in most cases it is not followed. Sand and brick carrying trawlers and cargo are prohibited on the waterways at night but the rules are not followed. There is no Marine Magistrate to look after the irregular navigation of the drivers. The authorities concerned do not conduct regular mobile courts to maintain the riverways discipline.River police cannot take immediate action. None of the port officers were given the power to collect fines and punish. In the last four decades, 20,000 cases have been filed for naval accidents, but only 200 have been settled. Again there are not enough manpower and equipment that can quickly rescue people after an accident. There is no alternative to intensifying patrols for preventing launch accidents on waterways. It is possible to control accidents through proper management and proper supervision by strengthening river patrols.The writer is an assistant professor, BAF Shaheen College, Kurmitola, Dhaka Cantonmen","Initiative must be taken to prevent boat accident: Waterway is one of the popular means of communication in riverine Bangladesh. Recently a collision between a sand-carrying bulkhead and a speed boat in Madaripur killed 26 passengers. According to newspaper, there is no registration of both water vehicles. Hundreds of people die in launch accidents in Bangladesh every year. On April 4, a passenger launch sank in the Shitalakshya River after being hit by a cargo ship, killing 29 people. Often such launch accidents happen and many people lose their lives.There are various reasons behind launch accidents: overloading, incompetent drivers, mismanagement, faulty launch design, lack of supervision, corruption, political interference and negligence. Although there have been frequent launch sinking incidents in the country, we have not seen sufficient instance of punishment of the culprits. Laws to prevent launch accidents have not yet been enacted. A government ordinance of 1976 has been amended more than once but that is not enough.Launch accidents often occur due to lack of regular supervision. Earlier, the Ministry of Shipping had identified 9 reasons behind the loss of life in the launch accident on the river Buriganga and recommended 20 points to avoid such accidents in the future. These recommendations included stopping boat bathing near the Sadar Ghat, removing the ferry, mandating voice declarations, setting speed limits, lifting old-fashioned launches, stop selling extra tickets, and modernizing naval law by increasing penalties, ensuring life-saving life jackets and efficient drivers.According to government estimates, 35 per cent of Bangladesh's people travel waterways. Although launch accidents happen all the time, very little action has been taken against the culprits. According to a survey, there have been more than 400 river accidents in the last four decades and about 10,000 people have died. The main reason behind all these accidents was mismanagement.

There have been many launch accidents in the last four decades and there have been a lot of investigative committees but those investigation reports have not really come to light. A few reports of the inquiry committee have been published but no action has been taken to implement the recommendations made there.Twelve major accidents have taken place in Bangladesh in the last twenty years, killing about 1,500 people. On August 4, 2014, a launch with 250 passengers sank in river. According to a survey, 42% of launch accidents happens due to collisions on the river alone. More than 4,000 people have been killed in 570 launch accidents in 29 years, mainly due to incompetence of drivers and carelessness. Launch owners and operators behave recklessly as there is no provision for severe punishment.There have been several attempts to increase the punishment of the accused in the launch accident but that too has not seen the light. According to the survey, 42.70 per cent of accidents are due to collisions, 24.70 per cent are due to overcrowding, 23.6 per cent are due to hostile weather and 6.17 per cent are due to explosions and fires. Owners and drivers are reckless due to the lack of severe penalties. Negligence and corruption in investigations is high and this leads to frequent accidents.There is a shortage of manpower required to restore order and adequate supervision of the waterways. A large number of unfit launches are operating on the waterways at great risk and are often the victims of accidents. There is only one marine court in the country to handle the trial of naval accidents but there is also a complex of cases. There are many cargo ships without registration and fitness and sand carrier launch one of them. These sand-carrying trawlers are one of the causes of accidents. There is negligence of the officials concerned of BIWTA in this case.A launch is supposed to be run by a skilled master or driver of the prescribed grade but in most cases it is not followed. Sand and brick carrying trawlers and cargo are prohibited on the waterways at night but the rules are not followed. There is no Marine Magistrate to look after the irregular navigation of the drivers. The authorities concerned do not conduct regular mobile courts to maintain the riverways discipline.River police cannot take immediate action. None of the port officers were given the power to collect fines and punish. In the last four decades, 20,000 cases have been filed for naval accidents, but only 200 have been settled. Again there are not enough manpower and equipment that can quickly rescue people after an accident. There is no alternative to intensifying patrols for preventing launch accidents on waterways. It is possible to control accidents through proper management and proper supervision by strengthening river patrols.The writer is an assistant professor, BAF Shaheen College, Kurmitola, Dhaka Cantonmen","Initiative must be taken to prevent boat accident: Waterway is one of the popular means of communication in riverine Bangladesh. Recently a collision between a sand-carrying bulkhead and a speed boat in Madaripur killed 26 passengers. According to newspaper, there is no registration of both water vehicles. Hundreds of people die in launch accidents in Bangladesh every year. On April 4, a passenger launch sank in the Shitalakshya River after being hit by a cargo ship, killing 29 people. Often such launch accidents happen and many people lose their lives.There are various reasons behind launch accidents: overloading, incompetent drivers, mismanagement, faulty launch design, lack of supervision, corruption, political interference and negligence. Although there have been frequent launch sinking incidents in the country, we have not seen sufficient instance of punishment of the culprits. Laws to prevent launch accidents have not yet been enacted. A government ordinance of 1976 has been amended more than once but that is not enough.Launch accidents often occur due to lack of regular supervision. Earlier, the Ministry of Shipping had identified 9 reasons behind the loss of life in the launch accident on the river Buriganga and recommended 20 points to avoid such accidents in the future. These recommendations included stopping boat bathing near the Sadar Ghat, removing the ferry, mandating voice declarations, setting speed limits, lifting old-fashioned launches, stop selling extra tickets, and modernizing naval law by increasing penalties, ensuring life-saving life jackets and efficient drivers.According to government estimates, 35 per cent of Bangladesh's people travel waterways. Although launch accidents happen all the time, very little action has been taken against the culprits. According to a survey, there have been more than 400 river accidents in the last four decades and about 10,000 people have died. The main reason behind all these accidents was mismanagement. Of the hundreds of launches operating on the Dhaka-Barisal route, only 10 to 15 have licensed drivers and the rest are all inexperienced and incompetent. There are more than thirty thousand river vehicles in Bangladesh, big and small, and only 9000 of them have fitness certificates.The Department of Maritime Transport has 4/5 surveyors to test the fitness of the vessel and it is really difficult and arduous to check the fitness with this number of surveyors. In many cases the fitness of these vessels is given without inspection which is really terrifying. Most launches do not have enough modern equipment and do not have the technology they need to get bad weather news. Although GPS technology has been introduced in some launches, most launches still retain that old style and are defective.Radars are needed to avoid collisions with other launches or vessels, but launches do not have adequate radars. The law of 1976 provides for a maximum imprisonment of five years, a fine of 1 lakh taka and compensation of 5 lakh taka against the owner convicted of a launch accident. However, in most cases, the launch owners are released after paying a fine.

https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=306392,Despite moves govt fails to curb road accidents,"Despite the government's initiatives it has failed to stop fatal road accidents across the country. The government has failed to prevent unauthorized vehicles, including Easy Bike (battery-run human haulers) and Nasimon (locally-made vehicles), from running on highways.The number of fatal accidents involving three-wheelers is increasing in rural areas as they run on highways side by side with speedy, bigger and stronger vehicles. Recently a deadly crash on the Dhaka-Rajshahi Highway left at least 17 people dead in Rajshahi. Eleven of whom were burnt to death after one of the vehicles caught fire last week. Of the accidents, the highest number of accidents (1127) happened involving motorcycles while the number of bus was 698, truck 931, car and jeeps 410 and the rest were other types of vehicles.The rate of bike accidents was 19 percent in 2019 while it rose by eight percentage points     to 27 percent last year.Ilias Kanchan, the Chairman of the road safety movement, revealed the information at his last press conferences citing the data of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). Ilias Kanchan said 17.53 lakh motorcycle licences were issued against 30.32 lakh registered bikes, meaning 12.79 bikers are riding without licence right under the nose of law enforcers.Although there is positive practice of using helmets in city areas, this practice is missing in the countryside, he said, adding that use of bikes by unlicensed and young bikers as well as political activists with no regard for the law are the main reasons behind the accidents.Talking while riding bikes are also a major reason behind accidents, he said. Imposing restriction on use of bikes by teens, and making training and licence mandatory for bikers is necessary for decreasing the number of accidents.Lack of public transports, infrastructure, skilled and professional drivers, proper planning and awareness among people has contributed to the situation, experts said.The number of fatal accidents involving motorbikes, particularly in the capital, is increasing due to ridesharing services, experts also said.The accident researcher said due to absence of service lanes and alternative transports slow-moving vehicles ran on highways and accidents occurred.  The authorities should introduce buses on highways for small distances to keep slow-moving vehicles off such roads.According to Dhaka Metropolitan Police additional commissioner (traffic) that their main target was to improve the mass transport system.""We are also trying to improve the existing bus system by fixing bus stoppages, introducing locked-door and air-conditioned buses,"" a police source said, adding, ""The number of private vehicles should be reduced and people should be encouraged to use buses.""Then the demand for motorcycles would also go down, he observed. ""We are trying our best to reduce the number of accidents and casualties,"" he added.According to BRTA statistics, the number of total registered motor vehicles in the capital last year was 14.93 lakh out of which around 46 percent was motorcycles.The total number of registered motorbikes in Dhaka was 46,764 in 2015, which increased to 53,738 in 2016, to 75,251 in 2017, to 1.07 lakh in 2018 to 1.21 lakh in 2019 and over 1.32 lakh in 2020.","Despite moves govt fails to curb road accidents: Despite the government's initiatives it has failed to stop fatal road accidents across the country.

Of the accidents, the highest number of accidents (1127) happened involving motorcycles while the number of bus was 698, truck 931, car and jeeps 410 and the rest were other types of vehicles.The rate of bike accidents was 19 percent in 2019 while it rose by eight percentage points     to 27 percent last year.Ilias Kanchan, the Chairman of the road safety movement, revealed the information at his last press conferences citing the data of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). Ilias Kanchan said 17.53 lakh motorcycle licences were issued against 30.32 lakh registered bikes, meaning 12.79 bikers are riding without licence right under the nose of law enforcers.Although there is positive practice of using helmets in city areas, this practice is missing in the countryside, he said, adding that use of bikes by unlicensed and young bikers as well as political activists with no regard for the law are the main reasons behind the accidents.Talking while riding bikes are also a major reason behind accidents, he said. Imposing restriction on use of bikes by teens, and making training and licence mandatory for bikers is necessary for decreasing the number of accidents.Lack of public transports, infrastructure, skilled and professional drivers, proper planning and awareness among people has contributed to the situation, experts said.The number of fatal accidents involving motorbikes, particularly in the capital, is increasing due to ridesharing services, experts also said.The accident researcher said due to absence of service lanes and alternative transports slow-moving vehicles ran on highways and accidents occurred.  The authorities should introduce buses on highways for small distances to keep slow-moving vehicles off such roads.According to Dhaka Metropolitan Police additional commissioner (traffic) that their main target was to improve the mass transport system.""We are also trying to improve the existing bus system by fixing bus stoppages, introducing locked-door and air-conditioned buses,"" a police source said, adding, ""The number of private vehicles should be reduced and people should be encouraged to use buses.""Then the demand for motorcycles would also go down, he observed.

https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=297416,Reasons and preventive measures to road accident,"Reasons and preventive measures to road accident In recent times, Bangladesh is experiencing an alarming increase of road accidents. Rapid increase of vehicle is causing massive fatalities leading to many social tragedies.  According to WHO, the economic cost of road accidents in developing countries like Bangladesh is 2-3per cent of GDP.  From different surveys and news reports we have learned that the casualties usually happen mostly in highways where some speedy vehicles rule the streets. Some vehicles do not follow any traffic rules and get involve in madly races. The reasons for rampant road accident in massive scales are as follows. 1. A high growth in urbanization and motorization can be identified as one of the factors leading to the higher number of road accidents. Unregulated  movement  of  non-motorized  vehicles  along  with motorized  vehicles on  the  same  route is  also  one of  the  major causes for road accidents.2. The  rapid  economic  growth,  increasing  disposable income  and  urbanization  are  raising  the  demands  for transportation  rapidly  in  developing  countries. As  a  result,  the numbers  of  vehicles  on  roads of  developing  countries  are also increasing  rapidly. 3. The heterogeneity of traffic exceeding the capacity, plying of modes with varying speed and manipulation time make the road links as well as intersections even more complicated. 4. Irresponsible driving, risky overtaking, fault in road design, unfit vehicles, unskilled drivers, continuously longer driving hours than their stipulated schedules, use of drug and alcohol, passengers and pedestrians' unawareness, use of mobile phones or headphone while driving vehicles, occupied footpath and poor enforcement of law for the road crashes are also the  major causes for road accidents.5. Sometimes massive movement of the teenage or unconscious students across the country, results the death of the students hit by the speedy bus. Therefore, road accident steals many lives of innocent children, men, and women while injuring countless others.6. Faulty road constructions, lack of political will, lack of proper implementation of traffic rules and lack of proper coordination between structural development authorities are also the dominant causes behind the road accidents.7. Narrow road structures cause vehicles to slip. There are potholes and cracks on the roads, uneven speed breakers (some without the paint marking them) and unhealthy competition between buses can cause vehicles to lose control and crash or hit other vehicles and people. 8. Geometric defects like substandard design road pattern, lack of soiling, muddy roads, exceeding damage in rainy season, lack of proper management in road network etc are the notable responsible issues causing road accidents. The traffic police department has a crucial role to play in identifying and holding accountable inattentive driving, speeding and unstable or overloaded vehicles. The following could also be executed:1. An important factor  in road  safety management is  the collection and  use  of  accurate  and  comprehensive  data  related  to  road accidents. The interpretation of those data is a pre- requisite for an accurate diagnosis of accident problems and taking curative measures.   2. The prevalence of underreporting is a common problem. Therefore incorporating modern technologies like  using  GIS  techniques  in  collection  and  recording  of  data  is necessary. 3. The main areas that need to be worked on thoroughly by the government are maintenance, repair and expansion of roads united with setting up dividers on national highways, cautioning signals for unsafe locations, disseminating information on driving and road safety to more than enough through media. Parts of highway from illegal occupants should also have to be released.Reasons and preventive measures to road accident 4. The passengers also have to play a role in ensuring road safety. While travelling in public transports, passengers should protest and stop speeding and reckless driving by bus and taxi drivers. Furthermore, passengers should, under no circumstances, be allowed to sit on the roofs of vehicles while travelling.5. As an owner of motor vehicles we should have to ensure genuine licenses of employed drivers along with proper training and responsibly. Road safety education especially for the children is also a good way to promote road safety.6. Transport companies must take care of their drivers by providing accommodation in a healthy environment and should also appoint two drivers for the long routes. 7. There are thousands of unregistered vehicles in Bangladesh which are frequently involved in accidents. There need to be routine checks of the vehicles before setting out for the road and the substandard vehicles should be banned.  8. It is necessary to build an individualized preventive approach in each location like level crossings, overpasses, and underpasses that is prone to causing road traffic accidents.9. For a long-term solution, increasing public awareness through evidence-informed strategies, increasing the level of traffic sagacity detailed enforcement of road traffic legislation and stricter punishments can improve road safety. Again, a nation-wide awareness campaign could be organized and implemented by the government in collaboration with development organizations. The campaign should be delivered to the public through print, television, radio, and online media so that a substantial portion of the population can be reached.Finally the government should monitor vehicles on roads and highways more strictly, take steps to rid or minimize corruption in the process of issuing drivers' licenses and for ensuring government cooperation, a separate unit should have to be formed under the Communication Ministry to assess the causes of road accidents and find solutions.Dr ATM Rezaul Hoque is a Professor, Department of Economics, Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University","Reasons and preventive measures to road accident:  In recent times, Bangladesh is experiencing an alarming increase of road accidents.

Rapid increase of vehicle is causing massive fatalities leading to many social tragedies.  According to WHO, the economic cost of road accidents in developing countries like Bangladesh is 2-3per cent of GDP.  From different surveys and news reports we have learned that the casualties usually happen mostly in highways where some speedy vehicles rule the streets. Some vehicles do not follow any traffic rules and get involve in madly races. The reasons for rampant road accident in massive scales are as follows. 1. A high growth in urbanization and motorization can be identified as one of the factors leading to the higher number of road accidents. Unregulated  movement  of  non-motorized  vehicles  along  with motorized  vehicles on  the  same  route is  also  one of  the  major causes for road accidents.2. The  rapid  economic  growth,  increasing  disposable income  and  urbanization  are  raising  the  demands  for transportation  rapidly  in  developing  countries. As  a  result,  the numbers  of  vehicles  on  roads of  developing  countries  are also increasing  rapidly. 3. The heterogeneity of traffic exceeding the capacity, plying of modes with varying speed and manipulation time make the road links as well as intersections even more complicated. 4. Irresponsible driving, risky overtaking, fault in road design, unfit vehicles, unskilled drivers, continuously longer driving hours than their stipulated schedules, use of drug and alcohol, passengers and pedestrians' unawareness, use of mobile phones or headphone while driving vehicles, occupied footpath and poor enforcement of law for the road crashes are also the  major causes for road accidents.5.

Some vehicles do not follow any traffic rules and get involve in madly races. The reasons for rampant road accident in massive scales are as follows. 1. A high growth in urbanization and motorization can be identified as one of the factors leading to the higher number of road accidents. Unregulated  movement  of  non-motorized  vehicles  along  with motorized  vehicles on  the  same  route is  also  one of  the  major causes for road accidents.2. The  rapid  economic  growth,  increasing  disposable income  and  urbanization  are  raising  the  demands  for transportation  rapidly  in  developing  countries. As  a  result,  the numbers  of  vehicles  on  roads of  developing  countries  are also increasing  rapidly. 3. The heterogeneity of traffic exceeding the capacity, plying of modes with varying speed and manipulation time make the road links as well as intersections even more complicated. 4. Irresponsible driving, risky overtaking, fault in road design, unfit vehicles, unskilled drivers, continuously longer driving hours than their stipulated schedules, use of drug and alcohol, passengers and pedestrians' unawareness, use of mobile phones or headphone while driving vehicles, occupied footpath and poor enforcement of law for the road crashes are also the  major causes for road accidents.5. Sometimes massive movement of the teenage or unconscious students across the country, results the death of the students hit by the speedy bus. Therefore, road accident steals many lives of innocent children, men, and women while injuring countless others.6. Faulty road constructions, lack of political will, lack of proper implementation of traffic rules and lack of proper coordination between structural development authorities are also the dominant causes behind the road accidents.7. Narrow road structures cause vehicles to slip. There are potholes and cracks on the roads, uneven speed breakers (some without the paint marking them) and unhealthy competition between buses can cause vehicles to lose control and crash or hit other vehicles and people. 8. Geometric defects like substandard design road pattern, lack of soiling, muddy roads, exceeding damage in rainy season, lack of proper management in road network etc are the notable responsible issues causing road accidents. The traffic police department has a crucial role to play in identifying and holding accountable inattentive driving, speeding and unstable or overloaded vehicles. The following could also be executed:1. An important factor  in road  safety management is  the collection and  use  of  accurate  and  comprehensive  data  related  to  road accidents. The interpretation of those data is a pre- requisite for an accurate diagnosis of accident problems and taking curative measures.   2. The prevalence of underreporting is a common problem. Therefore incorporating modern technologies like  using  GIS  techniques  in  collection  and  recording  of  data  is necessary. 3. The main areas that need to be worked on thoroughly by the government are maintenance, repair and expansion of roads united with setting up dividers on national highways, cautioning signals for unsafe locations, disseminating information on driving and road safety to more than enough through media. Parts of highway from illegal occupants should also have to be released.Reasons and preventive measures to road accident:  4. The passengers also have to play a role in ensuring road safety. While travelling in public transports, passengers should protest and stop speeding and reckless driving by bus and taxi drivers. Furthermore, passengers should, under no circumstances, be allowed to sit on the roofs of vehicles while travelling.5. As an owner of motor vehicles we should have to ensure genuine licenses of employed drivers along with proper training and responsibly. Road safety education especially for the children is also a good way to promote road safety.6. Transport companies must take care of their drivers by providing accommodation in a healthy environment and should also appoint two drivers for the long routes. 7. There are thousands of unregistered vehicles in Bangladesh which are frequently involved in accidents. There need to be routine checks of the vehicles before setting out for the road and the substandard vehicles should be banned.  8. It is necessary to build an individualized preventive approach in each location like level crossings, overpasses, and underpasses that is prone to causing road traffic accidents.9. For a long-term solution, increasing public awareness through evidence-informed strategies, increasing the level of traffic sagacity detailed enforcement of road traffic legislation and stricter punishments can improve road safety. Again, a nation-wide awareness campaign could be organized and implemented by the government in collaboration with development organizations. The campaign should be delivered to the public through print, television, radio, and online media so that a substantial portion of the population can be reached.Finally the government should monitor vehicles on roads and highways more strictly, take steps to rid or minimize corruption in the process of issuing drivers' licenses and for ensuring government cooperation, a separate unit should have to be formed under the Communication Ministry to assess the causes of road accidents and find solutions.Dr ATM Rezaul Hoque is a Professor, Department of Economics, Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University",2021,Thursday,04-Feb,,12:00 AM,"Thursday, 4 February, 2021 at 12:00 AM",,,,,,1,1,

The bacteria have reportedly been suspected to exist for over a century but has not been proved.The tiny microbes were discovered by accident, as scientists were performing unrelated experiments with manganese, a mineral usually found in combination with iron. Dr. Jared Leadbetter, professor of environmental microbiology at Caltech, left a glass jar covered with the substance to soak in his office sink.He did not return to the office for several months while he was working off campus, but upon his return found the jar covered with a dark substance later found to be oxidised manganese. That compound was formed by the bacteria.Scientists had previously known that bacteria and fungi could oxidise manganese or strip it of electronics, but microbes that could use such actions to drive growth were yet to be discovered.""These are the first bacteria found to use manganese as their source of fuel,"" Leadbetter said. ""A wonderful aspect of microbes in nature is that they can metabolize seemingly unlikely materials, like metals, yielding energy useful to the cell.""""There is evidence that relatives of these creatures reside in groundwater, and a portion of Pasadena's drinking water is pumped from local aquifers,"" Leadbetter added, as reported by CNN.Groundwater is water present beneath the Earth's surface, located in cracks in soil, sand, and rocks.

https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=263155,Mad rush blamed for Monday’s launch accident,"The passenger carrier small water vessel 'MV Morning Bird' went under water as it attempted to overtake the gigantic launch 'Mayur-2' near Shyambazar killing at least 30 people.Dhaka-bound 'MV Morning Bird' from Munshiganj was heading towards Sadarghat when the accident took place.Witnesses of the area said it was trying to overtake Mayur-2 resulting in the deadly capsize in the Buriganga River. The dead included eight women and three children. The witnesses and persons involved in the water transport sector claimed that it was the first accident for overtaking in and around Sadarghat.Unnecessary overtaking in haste caused the accident, said the witnesses. Rasu Miah Majhi, a witness to the accident, told this correspondent that 'MV Morning Bird' sank as     it attempted to overtake 'Mayur-2'. The launch was in a hurry to drop its passengers from Munshiganj to attend their offices or shops, he said.More than 100 passengers were aboard the 'MV Morning Bird' when it capsized in the river after it had been hit by the Mayur-2, he said. The Mayur-2 hit the back of the small water vessel. Among the passengers, around 50 people managed to swim ashore with the help of locals and the rests lost lives.The Fire Service authorities said 30 bodies had been recovered from the sunken launch and sent to the Sir Salimullah Medical College Mitford Hospital. Launch owner Rasel Miah and Master Mohammad Badal Mia told this correspondent that many private employees and businessmen come to Dhaka from Munshiganj every day. As most of the private employees travel in those vessels in the morning, the masters normally try to drop them quickly so that they can attend offices in time.The driver of 'Morning Bird' might have tried to reach the wharf quickly overtaking Mayur-2, they added. Mohammad Badal Mia, the In-Charge of 'Jamal-9', said usually small launches carry a large number of officials and employees and small traders. They come from different adjacent places of Dhaka for work. That is why the drivers of these launches try to reach Dhaka very fast, he added.About the accident on Monday Mohammad Badal Mia said although the Mayur-2 was at low speed it was not possible for it to stop it immediately. It would have been possible to avoid the accident if Mayur-2 had had some more time, he observed.However, Badal Mia noted that larger water vessels should give space to smaller ones if the small ones move closer to larger ones. Meanwhile, the Shipping Ministry has formed a seven-member inquiry committee with Joint Secretary (Development) of the Ministry of Shipping Md Rafiqul Islam Khan as the Convener. The committee was asked to submit its report to the Ministry of Shipping within the next seven days.","Mad rush blamed for Monday’s launch accident: The passenger carrier small water vessel 'MV Morning Bird' went under water as it attempted to overtake the gigantic launch 'Mayur-2' near Shyambazar killing at least 30 people.Dhaka-bound 'MV Morning Bird' from Munshiganj was heading towards Sadarghat when the accident took place.Witnesses of the area said it was trying to overtake Mayur-2 resulting in the deadly capsize in the Buriganga River.

https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=238088,What does the law say regarding fire accidents?,"What does the law say regarding fire accidents?Tragic fire incidents are caused due to lack of fire safety in the commercial buildings, residential buildings, hospitals, supermarkets, educational institutions and even the slum areas where the poorest sections of our society reside. People of all classes are now falling victim to the terrible fire caused by such lacking of safety measures and unawareness.In November 2012, a fire broke in the Tazreen fashions factory in Bangladesh where garment workers were trapped due to narrow or blocked fire escapes and at least 112 workers died.Very recently, we witnessed the fire tragedy in Chawkbazar, Banani F.R tower caused by the unbridled greed of the building owners where 70 people and 25 people died helplessly and most recently in DNCC Market and Mirpur Slum Area.Many people lost their last hope and many became gravely injured.At least 16,000 incidents of fire have occurred around the country in the last 10 years, killing 1,590 people. The Fire service data had shown that at least 468 fire incidents struck only in the Puran Dhaka area alone. To take preventive measures against such terrifying fire incidents there are a number of laws that have been enacted such as Building Construction Rules 1996, Bangladesh National Building Code 2006, The Fire Prevention and Extinction Act, 2003 and The Fire Prevention and Extinction Rules, 2014 which look so much better in statute books but have very little implementation in practice.Besides, there are certain rules that are to be followed to build any building in Cities controlled by the authorities like RAJUK, CDA, RDA etc. But no one cares about the need to abide by the rules and regulations set in the statutes.Section 4 of the Fire Prevention and Extinction Act 2003 provides that if any person wants to use any building as warehouse or workshop, he shall have to take a license from the Directorate General of Fire Service and Civil Defense. Contravention of this section will result in imprisonment for 3 years or fine and the building along with goods kept in it shall be forfeited. Section 7 depicts, no structural design or layout of the multi-storied commercial building shall be approved or amended without the approval of the Directorate General of Fire Service and Civil Defence. Though all building owners collect the license in order to get an approval of their plan, there is no monitoring from the authority over the implementation of the relevant conditions. Moreover, RAJUK, City Corporation, Fire Service and Civil Defense are the related authorities to check on this issue but no authority is really concerned about their duties. Section 18 connotes that contravention of section 7 shall be dealt with imprisonment for 6 months or fine. Section 8 (3) directs every owner of the building to take precautions and other measures necessary for public safety. Also, Rule 22 of the Fire Prevention and Extinction Rules 2014 enumerates that owner of the building shall have to apply for an occupancy certificate of the building at the end of the construction. Rule 17(1) of the Building Construction Rules 1996 requires the establishment of the emergency exit gate and the installation of fire extinguisher machine or any other alternative arrangement along with fire alarms as an indication to leave the building. The Irony is, such public safety measures are barely seen in the buildings.To fence the curse of the fire incident, the government is obliged to take specific stricter approach by changing some of the provisions of existing laws and set up a new authoritative body through engaging non-governmental entities to regulate the building construction laws and rules, so that the safety measures are ensured and building code is maintained accordingly. Besides, the government must halt the corruption of the concerned authority while the technologically advanced equipment and latest training on putting out fire must be ensured among the firefighters and civil defence stations across the country. Moreover, we tend to discuss a lot for a few days when a tragic incident takes place, but any concrete action is never taken. And then the authorities also forget their responsibilities.The Government must act to stop the trend to avoid such tragic incidents in the future.

To take preventive measures against such terrifying fire incidents there are a number of laws that have been enacted such as Building Construction Rules 1996, Bangladesh National Building Code 2006, The Fire Prevention and Extinction Act, 2003 and The Fire Prevention and Extinction Rules, 2014 which look so much better in statute books but have very little implementation in practice.Besides, there are certain rules that are to be followed to build any building in Cities controlled by the authorities like RAJUK, CDA, RDA etc. But no one cares about the need to abide by the rules and regulations set in the statutes.Section 4 of the Fire Prevention and Extinction Act 2003 provides that if any person wants to use any building as warehouse or workshop, he shall have to take a license from the Directorate General of Fire Service and Civil Defense. Contravention of this section will result in imprisonment for 3 years or fine and the building along with goods kept in it shall be forfeited. Section 7 depicts, no structural design or layout of the multi-storied commercial building shall be approved or amended without the approval of the Directorate General of Fire Service and Civil Defence. Though all building owners collect the license in order to get an approval of their plan, there is no monitoring from the authority over the implementation of the relevant conditions. Moreover, RAJUK, City Corporation, Fire Service and Civil Defense are the related authorities to check on this issue but no authority is really concerned about their duties. Section 18 connotes that contravention of section 7 shall be dealt with imprisonment for 6 months or fine. Section 8 (3) directs every owner of the building to take precautions and other measures necessary for public safety. Also, Rule 22 of the Fire Prevention and Extinction Rules 2014 enumerates that owner of the building shall have to apply for an occupancy certificate of the building at the end of the construction. Rule 17(1) of the Building Construction Rules 1996 requires the establishment of the emergency exit gate and the installation of fire extinguisher machine or any other alternative arrangement along with fire alarms as an indication to leave the building. The Irony is, such public safety measures are barely seen in the buildings.To fence the curse of the fire incident, the government is obliged to take specific stricter approach by changing some of the provisions of existing laws and set up a new authoritative body through engaging non-governmental entities to regulate the building construction laws and rules, so that the safety measures are ensured and building code is maintained accordingly. Besides, the government must halt the corruption of the concerned authority while the technologically advanced equipment and latest training on putting out fire must be ensured among the firefighters and civil defence stations across the country. Moreover, we tend to discuss a lot for a few days when a tragic incident takes place, but any concrete action is never taken. And then the authorities also forget their responsibilities.The Government must act to stop the trend to avoid such tragic incidents in the future.

https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=227832,Technology can prevent road accident,"Technology can prevent road accidentIn 1886, when Karl Benz invented the automobile, people began to think about some automobile-related issues, especially issues related to the safety of cars and passengers.As the use of automobiles is increasing day by day, the number of road accident is increasing proportional to that, as a result, the death rate is rising, and those who survived, many of them become paralyzed and started living confined to four walls. Like other developed countries in the world, road accident is a major issue in Bangladesh. Apart from ensuring wider roads, trained drivers and slow driving, another concern can help preventing or reducing road accident and that is Technology. Vehicle or Automobile Safety Technology is a subject of advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS, and it has a vast area. As I said before that the development of vehicle safety technology started in the 19th century, just after the invention of the automobile. In that era, safety features of an automobile was known as safety glass, hydraulic brake, seat belt etc. Safety Technology saw a remarkable development in 1934, when General Motors started Crash Test for the first time. Crash Test is a test where the crashworthiness and sustainability and impact of crash/accident are assessed by occurring accidental simulation in cars and dummies. Later, Disc brake and Anti-Lock Braking system were invented. In the 20th century, road accident became one of the major reasons for death. As a result, apart from increasing awareness, technology became a big weapon for reducing and preventing road accidents. Since then, several companies started developing safety technologies. In 1995, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) was invented which was featured with powerful technology, though it wasn't used in every car. In 1999, Lane Departure Warning system was invented, it was another milestone of automobile safety technology. From the beginning of the 21st Century, most of the car manufacturing companies started implementing safety technology in their cars. In 2003, Honda and Toyota started implementing Autonomous Brake System.These all were not fully automated. In 2009, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began studying to make frontal collision warning systems and lane departure warning systems. In 2012, a research by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety examined how particular features of crash-avoidance systems affected the number of claims under various forms of insurance coverage. This indicates that, two crash-avoidance features provide the biggest benefits, these are (a) autonomous braking that would brake on its own when the driver isn't concern to avoid a forward collision and (b) adaptive headlights that would shift the headlights in the direction, in which, the driver steers. At the circa 2012 stage of development, it's found from this research that lane departure system is not helpful and perhaps harmful. Periodically anti-car collision features are rapidly making their way into the new vehicle fleet. Many car companies like BMW, Audi, Mercedes- Benz , Ford, Toyota, Volvo developed vehicle collision avoidance system from 2003-2009, but not necessarily they are all time effective. Thus it is the main aim to ensure the safety of human life during the collision, the U.S National High Way Traffic Safety Administration has decided to make the pre-crash system mandatory for vehicles.Toyota has already given an official announcement that they are going to give this automated vehicles avoidance system in their Toyota & Lexus models by 2017. On the other hand, BMW has already introduced satisfactory & effective anti-car collision system on BMW 7series in 2012. Volvo Company has launched this system in Volvo FH by February 2013. Hope in near future, Apart from all the existing technologies, some other technologies will be introduced as well which will contribute to prevent road accidents.","Technology can prevent road accident: In 1886, when Karl Benz invented the automobile, people began to think about some automobile-related issues, especially issues related to the safety of cars and passengers.As the use of automobiles is increasing day by day, the number of road accident is increasing proportional to that, as a result, the death rate is rising, and those who survived, many of them become paralyzed and started living confined to four walls.

Later, Disc brake and Anti-Lock Braking system were invented. In the 20th century, road accident became one of the major reasons for death. As a result, apart from increasing awareness, technology became a big weapon for reducing and preventing road accidents. Since then, several companies started developing safety technologies. In 1995, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) was invented which was featured with powerful technology, though it wasn't used in every car. In 1999, Lane Departure Warning system was invented, it was another milestone of automobile safety technology. From the beginning of the 21st Century, most of the car manufacturing companies started implementing safety technology in their cars. In 2003, Honda and Toyota started implementing Autonomous Brake System.These all were not fully automated. In 2009, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began studying to make frontal collision warning systems and lane departure warning systems. In 2012, a research by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety examined how particular features of crash-avoidance systems affected the number of claims under various forms of insurance coverage. This indicates that, two crash-avoidance features provide the biggest benefits, these are (a) autonomous braking that would brake on its own when the driver isn't concern to avoid a forward collision and (b) adaptive headlights that would shift the headlights in the direction, in which, the driver steers. At the circa 2012 stage of development, it's found from this research that lane departure system is not helpful and perhaps harmful. Periodically anti-car collision features are rapidly making their way into the new vehicle fleet. Many car companies like BMW, Audi, Mercedes- Benz , Ford, Toyota, Volvo developed vehicle collision avoidance system from 2003-2009, but not necessarily they are all time effective. Thus it is the main aim to ensure the safety of human life during the collision, the U.S National High Way Traffic Safety Administration has decided to make the pre-crash system mandatory for vehicles.Toyota has already given an official announcement that they are going to give this automated vehicles avoidance system in their Toyota & Lexus models by 2017. On the other hand, BMW has already introduced satisfactory & effective anti-car collision system on BMW 7series in 2012. Volvo Company has launched this system in Volvo FH by February 2013.

We appreciate the observance of National Road Safety Day - 2019 on Tuesday 22nd October in Dhaka and across the country. This is the third time, all the authorities responsible and concern came forward with an objective to build mass awareness to reduce rate of accidents. This time the slogan was: 'Jiboner agay jibika noy'. sarak durghatana ar noy' ( Livelihood is not before life, No more road accident ).Accident is an unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly resulting injury or death. Accidents may occur in any of the three means of transportation - road, water and air. Among the three, road accident is undoubtedly the most common, frequent and a great cause of injury or death. Accident causes harm to a family, a society and the country.Only an accident survivor can realize the pain, the sufferings and the curse of the incident beside his or her family members, relatives and friends. Every moment, he is being chased by fear, tear, insomnia and a dreadful trauma of the mishap in his life. According to Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Organization, 7,221 people died of road accident in the year 2018 across the country and 15,446 people were injured in 5,514 road crashes throughout the year.The authorities concerned, government agencies have limitations to the issue except to convey deep condolence to media in some of the fatal accidents with assurance of fair justice to the victim or his family. Meantime, the bus owners are quite reluctant to extend any sort of humanitarian or remarkable financial assistance to the victim and his family, in case of severe injury or death. Even, they do not bother to pay a visit to the victim either in hospital or at home to console the members of the bereaved family.Instead, the bus owners remain busy finding umbrella to get lawful, judicial and political shelter whatever is fast and suitable for him, his transport and his driver. On the other hand, the transport workers remain busy in raising their voices, road- blockade, strikes in favour of their fellow-driver to prove his innocence and freed him from the hands of the law. Over and above, a strong and powerful syndicate is working behind this sector and so the result at the end of the day is as before - no change and no improvement. The BRTA - Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, the law enforcing agencies and the concerned authorities are somewhat indifferent and compromising in executing their responsibilities fairly and so this sector is merged in infinite corruption.One of the causes of road accident is the qualification of drivers- in terms of age, education, patience, proper training and tendency of competition.Moreover, extreme traffic congestion, poor road condition, unfit vehicles, trip based vehicle hiring, constant pressure of the vehicle owners for more daily deposits and relatively great freedom of drivers facilitated by the authorities concerned. The pedestrians also play role in an accident due to their negligence in terms of availing a bus, crossing the roads, using head phones, listening music, reading papers / books, attending mobile calls, gossiping, avoiding traffic signals, zebra crossing and foot over bridge etc.Transport sector is a very important and essential sector, and without this sector we cannot move. Reasons behind known or unknown, it is being neglected, lack in proper care and attention by the transport and concerned authorities since long. We cannot put an end to accidents but at least we can try heart and soul to reduce the rate of accidents by implementing pragmatic policy for the welfare of the drivers, transport workers, transport owners and awareness campaign.It is a matter of concern that most of the drivers and assistants are deprived of minimum accommodation, food, sanitation, affection and good behave from owners and even members of the law enforcing agencies. With a view to reducing accident, transport sector should come under intensive care of the government agencies and transport owners without any delay and debate. In our view, we propose as follows:01. Drivers and their assistants should be appointed on fixed salary and wages and service benefits, thus abandoning the traditional 'trip system' or no wok no pay system beside fixation of duty hours. 02. Medical, risk coverage and insurance policies, long term service benefits may be introduced to make the profession more responsible and attractive. 03. Minimum age, minimum education and maximum age limit should be introduced for drivers.04. Routine wise medical check-up with emphasis on eye sight, ear, brain, alcohol, addiction and sexually transmitted disease at least twice in a year should be made mandatory for every driver either on short or long routes.05. Training should be offered time to time to enrich their technical know-how beside personal, social and national responsibility. 06. Mass awareness in terms of walking on road, availing a transport should be build up by conducting related program, documentary film and campaigns in schools, colleges, universities and offices time to time. 07. A chapter consisting detail information about walking on roads, crossing roads, availing a transport and maintaining discipline on roads should be included in primary and secondary syllabus including practical demonstration.08. Insurance system for both the drivers and passengers should be introduced.09. Special tribunal should be set up in every district to deal the incidents of accident as fast as possible or within 90 - ninety working days.10. All kinds of strike, road blockade and any attempt to interrupt normal communication on roads by transport workers or owners should be declared banned for the sake of national interest and financial loss.We humbly request the honourable ministers and the political leaders and all related to this important and essential sector to formulate plan and policies to make it an attractive sector free of politics and unrest. We must take sincere initiative to reduce the rate of accidents as much as possible within our limitation of capability and limited resources. In general, people are not ready to listen or respect anyone unless and until there is an emotional impact and influence that causes them never to forget.

According to Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Organization, 7,221 people died of road accident in the year 2018 across the country and 15,446 people were injured in 5,514 road crashes throughout the year.The authorities concerned, government agencies have limitations to the issue except to convey deep condolence to media in some of the fatal accidents with assurance of fair justice to the victim or his family. Meantime, the bus owners are quite reluctant to extend any sort of humanitarian or remarkable financial assistance to the victim and his family, in case of severe injury or death. Even, they do not bother to pay a visit to the victim either in hospital or at home to console the members of the bereaved family.Instead, the bus owners remain busy finding umbrella to get lawful, judicial and political shelter whatever is fast and suitable for him, his transport and his driver. On the other hand, the transport workers remain busy in raising their voices, road- blockade, strikes in favour of their fellow-driver to prove his innocence and freed him from the hands of the law. Over and above, a strong and powerful syndicate is working behind this sector and so the result at the end of the day is as before - no change and no improvement. The BRTA - Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, the law enforcing agencies and the concerned authorities are somewhat indifferent and compromising in executing their responsibilities fairly and so this sector is merged in infinite corruption.One of the causes of road accident is the qualification of drivers- in terms of age, education, patience, proper training and tendency of competition.Moreover, extreme traffic congestion, poor road condition, unfit vehicles, trip based vehicle hiring, constant pressure of the vehicle owners for more daily deposits and relatively great freedom of drivers facilitated by the authorities concerned. The pedestrians also play role in an accident due to their negligence in terms of availing a bus, crossing the roads, using head phones, listening music, reading papers / books, attending mobile calls, gossiping, avoiding traffic signals, zebra crossing and foot over bridge etc.Transport sector is a very important and essential sector, and without this sector we cannot move. Reasons behind known or unknown, it is being neglected, lack in proper care and attention by the transport and concerned authorities since long. We cannot put an end to accidents but at least we can try heart and soul to reduce the rate of accidents by implementing pragmatic policy for the welfare of the drivers, transport workers, transport owners and awareness campaign.It is a matter of concern that most of the drivers and assistants are deprived of minimum accommodation, food, sanitation, affection and good behave from owners and even members of the law enforcing agencies. With a view to reducing accident, transport sector should come under intensive care of the government agencies and transport owners without any delay and debate. In our view, we propose as follows:01. Drivers and their assistants should be appointed on fixed salary and wages and service benefits, thus abandoning the traditional 'trip system' or no wok no pay system beside fixation of duty hours. 02. Medical, risk coverage and insurance policies, long term service benefits may be introduced to make the profession more responsible and attractive. 03. Minimum age, minimum education and maximum age limit should be introduced for drivers.04. Routine wise medical check-up with emphasis on eye sight, ear, brain, alcohol, addiction and sexually transmitted disease at least twice in a year should be made mandatory for every driver either on short or long routes.05. Training should be offered time to time to enrich their technical know-how beside personal, social and national responsibility. 06. Mass awareness in terms of walking on road, availing a transport should be build up by conducting related program, documentary film and campaigns in schools, colleges, universities and offices time to time. 07. A chapter consisting detail information about walking on roads, crossing roads, availing a transport and maintaining discipline on roads should be included in primary and secondary syllabus including practical demonstration.08. Insurance system for both the drivers and passengers should be introduced.09. Special tribunal should be set up in every district to deal the incidents of accident as fast as possible or within 90 - ninety working days.10. All kinds of strike, road blockade and any attempt to interrupt normal communication on roads by transport workers or owners should be declared banned for the sake of national interest and financial loss.We humbly request the honourable ministers and the political leaders and all related to this important and essential sector to formulate plan and policies to make it an attractive sector free of politics and unrest. We must take sincere initiative to reduce the rate of accidents as much as possible within our limitation of capability and limited resources. In general, people are not ready to listen or respect anyone unless and until there is an emotional impact and influence that causes them never to forget.

https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=226359,Preventive measures must be adopted to reduce road accidents,"M A RAZZAQWe cannot avoid road accidents and, but at least we can try heart and soul to reduce the number of accidents as much as possible through awareness campaign among drivers and passengers. We appreciate the observance of National Road Safety Day - 2019 on Tuesday 22nd October in Dhaka and across the country. This is the third time, all the authorities responsible and concern came forward with an objective to build mass awareness to reduce rate of accidents. This time the slogan was: 'Jiboner agay jibika noy'. sarak durghatana ar noy' ( Livelihood is not before life, No more road accident ).Accident is an unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly resulting injury or death. Accidents may occur in any of the three means of transportation - road, water and air. Among the three, road accident is undoubtedly the most common, frequent and a great cause of injury or death. Accident causes harm to a family, a society and the country.Only an accident survivor can realize the pain, the sufferings and the curse of the incident beside his or her family members, relatives and friends. Every moment, he is being chased by fear, tear, insomnia and a dreadful trauma of the mishap in his life. According to Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Organization, 7,221 people died of road accident in the year 2018 across the country and 15,446 people were injured in 5,514 road crashes throughout the year.The authorities concerned, government agencies have limitations to the issue except to convey deep condolence to media in some of the fatal accidents with assurance of fair justice to the victim or his family. Meantime, the bus owners are quite reluctant to extend any sort of humanitarian or remarkable financial assistance to the victim and his family, in case of severe injury or death. Even, they do not bother to pay a visit to the victim either in hospital or at home to console the members of the bereaved family.Instead, the bus owners remain busy finding umbrella to get lawful, judicial and political shelter whatever is fast and suitable for him, his transport and his driver. On the other hand, the transport workers remain busy in raising their voices, road- blockade, strikes in favour of their fellow-driver to prove his innocence and freed him from the hands of the law. Over and above, a strong and powerful syndicate is working behind this sector and so the result at the end of the day is as before - no change and no improvement. The BRTA - Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, the law enforcing agencies and the concerned authorities are somewhat indifferent and compromising in executing their responsibilities fairly and so this sector is merged in infinite corruption.One of the causes of road accident is the qualification of drivers- in terms of age, education, patience, proper training and tendency of competition.Moreover, extreme traffic congestion, poor road condition, unfit vehicles, trip based vehicle hiring, constant pressure of the vehicle owners for more daily deposits and relatively great freedom of drivers facilitated by the authorities concerned. The pedestrians also play role in an accident due to their negligence in terms of availing a bus, crossing the roads, using head phones, listening music, reading papers / books, attending mobile calls, gossiping, avoiding traffic signals, zebra crossing and foot over bridge etc.Transport sector is a very important and essential sector, and without this sector we cannot move. Reasons behind known or unknown, it is being neglected, lack in proper care and attention by the transport and concerned authorities since long. We cannot put an end to accidents but at least we can try heart and soul to reduce the rate of accidents by implementing pragmatic policy for the welfare of the drivers, transport workers, transport owners and awareness campaign.It is a matter of concern that most of the drivers and assistants are deprived of minimum accommodation, food, sanitation, affection and good behave from owners and even members of the law enforcing agencies. With a view to reducing accident, transport sector should come under intensive care of the government agencies and transport owners without any delay and debate. In our view, we propose as follows:01. Drivers and their assistants should be appointed on fixed salary and wages and service benefits, thus abandoning the traditional 'trip system' or no wok no pay system beside fixation of duty hours. 02. Medical, risk coverage and insurance policies, long term service benefits may be introduced to make the profession more responsible and attractive. 03. Minimum age, minimum education and maximum age limit should be introduced for drivers.04. Routine wise medical check-up with emphasis on eye sight, ear, brain, alcohol, addiction and sexually transmitted disease at least twice in a year should be made mandatory for every driver either on short or long routes.05. Training should be offered time to time to enrich their technical know-how beside personal, social and national responsibility. 06. Mass awareness in terms of walking on road, availing a transport should be build up by conducting related program, documentary film and campaigns in schools, colleges, universities and offices time to time. 07. A chapter consisting detail information about walking on roads, crossing roads, availing a transport and maintaining discipline on roads should be included in primary and secondary syllabus including practical demonstration.08. Insurance system for both the drivers and passengers should be introduced.09. Special tribunal should be set up in every district to deal the incidents of accident as fast as possible or within 90 - ninety working days.10. All kinds of strike, road blockade and any attempt to interrupt normal communication on roads by transport workers or owners should be declared banned for the sake of national interest and financial loss.We humbly request the honourable ministers and the political leaders and all related to this important and essential sector to formulate plan and policies to make it an attractive sector free of politics and unrest. We must take sincere initiative to reduce the rate of accidents as much as possible within our limitation of capability and limited resources.

It is indeed a good idea to introduce instructions on road safety right from the school levels. Awareness about rules of the road ought to be ingrained in the minds of children at an impressionable age so that observing the rules becomes a second nature.One couldn't agree more with the PM that the drivers alone are not responsible for accidents, but it is also true that most of the accidents are the results of either rash driving or disregard for the safety of other road-users, or caused by untrained drivers and faulty vehicles. Therefore, infringement of rules, whoever may be responsible, should be dealt with firmly and punishment should be proportional to the nature of the violation. However, the need of the minute is a set of contemporary laws that should be enforced vigorously. Given the heavy toll of life, not to speak of a large number of accident victims rendered physically invalid due to accidents, implementation of a new law does not brook any delay. Regrettably, the Road Safety Act-2018, formulated after student agitation last year for safer roads, seems to have been stalled, even after the president's approval. We are dismayed at the reported efforts to water down some provisions about the punishments, which in themselves are already inadequate. And this is being done under pressure from transport workers and owners. For example, punishment for killing by reckless driving carries a maximum sentence of 5 years whereas simple robbery and robbery on highways at night carries a maximum sentence of 10 and 14 years respectively.Such a soft stance on a grievous offence to start with, and now the attempt to take an even more lenient position on deaths on roads, may well compel other stakeholders to ask whether the administration is at all serious about reducing road accidents. Undue pressures should be resisted and the proposed Road Safety Act should be implemented without any procrastination.Finally, staying safe in the roads is a shared responsibility. That said - from drivers to commuters all must ensure their part of responsibility diligently. And alertness is a crucial element to stay safe.

https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=194643,No let up in road accident deaths,"All government initiatives taken to curb road accidents across the country have, so far, failed. People are being killed almost every day, mostly pedestrians, and most accidents involve buses and human haulers that put the transport sector in a tailspin. According to BUET research at least 23 per cent of the road accidents in the country took place in city areas, of them, 74 per cent took place in Dhaka city alone.As many as 74 per cent of the accidents involved pedestrians, eight per cent rickshaws, three per cent motorcycles, two per cent by-cycles and 13 per cent others,  source said. According to the Accident Research Institute (ARI) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), over 1,000 people died in road crashes in the first three months of this year.Using police records as reference, ARI data shows that on average, 3,000 road accidents take place in the country annually, killing around 2,700 people and injuring about 2,400 others. However, data from Bangladesh      Passengers Welfare Association (BPWA) places the number of overall casualties from road crashes even higher.  According to their statistics, as many as 7,397 people lost their lives in 4,979 road accidents throughout Bangladesh in 2017, while another 16,193 were injured. Their data further shows that 6,055 people died and 15,914 were injured in 4,312 accidents in 2016. In 2015, a total of 7,221 people have died in road accidents across the country in 2018, according to a report of the BPWA. A further 15,446 people were injured in a total of 5,514 road crashes throughout the year, the report added.Mozammel Haque Chowdhury, secretary general of the organization earlier said  the victims in 41.53 per cent of the reported cases died as a result of being run over by vehicles while 29.72 per cent of the deaths occurred in head-on collisions between vehicles.Around 16.18 per cent of the road crash casualties resulted from vehicles falling into ditches. The number of fatalities from road crashes in 2018 is lower than last year despite an increase in the number of reported accidents, according to the report.The report also found that 394 were killed in a total of 370 railway accidents while 248 people were injured in 2018.  Waterway accidents left 126 dead and 234 injured while 387 people were reported missing.Around 35 lakh motor vehicles are registered with Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) while the number of driving licences issued by the authorities is around 24.5 lakh.  ""Until we get enough trained drivers, the problem won't be solved,"" Khandaker Enayetullah, secretary general of Bangladesh Sarak Paribahan Malik Samity, said.At least 87 per cent buses and minibuses ply the roads in the capital recklessly in violation of traffic rules, creating anarchy in the public transport sector, said a passenger welfare platform citing its survey covering over one thousand vehicles.The mismanagement in the road transport sector, reckless driving and race among vehicles to pick passengers came to the fore recently after several passengers died or suffered grave injuries in avoidable accidents.The number of road accidents saw a marked rise in the last two years due to a growing number of motorcycles, says a new survey of Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa).""It is mainly the indiscipline in the sector. Most street accidents involving buses happen when someone is getting on or off a bus,"" Mozammel said.Issues identified by experts include undisciplined drivers, encroachments on roads, absence of adequate footpaths, misplaced foot over bridges and crossings and commuters ignoring existing overpasses.Above all, an unhealthy competition takes place among bus companies, leading to reckless and unlawful driving, speeding, bus ramming and a host of other bad practices that go virtually unchecked.Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) Additional Commissioner (traffic) in a recent said, ""Many drivers do not have valid licences. Police fails to strictly enforce traffic laws because of a lack of manpower in the traffic division.""","No let up in road accident deaths: All government initiatives taken to curb road accidents across the country have, so far, failed.

According to the Accident Research Institute (ARI) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), over 1,000 people died in road crashes in the first three months of this year.Using police records as reference, ARI data shows that on average, 3,000 road accidents take place in the country annually, killing around 2,700 people and injuring about 2,400 others. However, data from Bangladesh      Passengers Welfare Association (BPWA) places the number of overall casualties from road crashes even higher.  According to their statistics, as many as 7,397 people lost their lives in 4,979 road accidents throughout Bangladesh in 2017, while another 16,193 were injured. Their data further shows that 6,055 people died and 15,914 were injured in 4,312 accidents in 2016. In 2015, a total of 7,221 people have died in road accidents across the country in 2018, according to a report of the BPWA. A further 15,446 people were injured in a total of 5,514 road crashes throughout the year, the report added.Mozammel Haque Chowdhury, secretary general of the organization earlier said  the victims in 41.53 per cent of the reported cases died as a result of being run over by vehicles while 29.72 per cent of the deaths occurred in head-on collisions between vehicles.Around 16.18 per cent of the road crash casualties resulted from vehicles falling into ditches. The number of fatalities from road crashes in 2018 is lower than last year despite an increase in the number of reported accidents, according to the report.The report also found that 394 were killed in a total of 370 railway accidents while 248 people were injured in 2018.  Waterway accidents left 126 dead and 234 injured while 387 people were reported missing.Around 35 lakh motor vehicles are registered with Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) while the number of driving licences issued by the authorities is around 24.5 lakh.  ""Until we get enough trained drivers, the problem won't be solved,"" Khandaker Enayetullah, secretary general of Bangladesh Sarak Paribahan Malik Samity, said.At least 87 per cent buses and minibuses ply the roads in the capital recklessly in violation of traffic rules, creating anarchy in the public transport sector, said a passenger welfare platform citing its survey covering over one thousand vehicles.The mismanagement in the road transport sector, reckless driving and race among vehicles to pick passengers came to the fore recently after several passengers died or suffered grave injuries in avoidable accidents.The number of road accidents saw a marked rise in the last two years due to a growing number of motorcycles, says a new survey of Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa).""It is mainly the indiscipline in the sector. Most street accidents involving buses happen when someone is getting on or off a bus,"" Mozammel said.Issues identified by experts include undisciplined drivers, encroachments on roads, absence of adequate footpaths, misplaced foot over bridges and crossings and commuters ignoring existing overpasses.Above all, an unhealthy competition takes place among bus companies, leading to reckless and unlawful driving, speeding, bus ramming and a host of other bad practices that go virtually unchecked.Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) Additional Commissioner (traffic) in a recent said, ""Many drivers do not have valid licences.

However, data from Bangladesh      Passengers Welfare Association (BPWA) places the number of overall casualties from road crashes even higher.  According to their statistics, as many as 7,397 people lost their lives in 4,979 road accidents throughout Bangladesh in 2017, while another 16,193 were injured. Their data further shows that 6,055 people died and 15,914 were injured in 4,312 accidents in 2016. In 2015, a total of 7,221 people have died in road accidents across the country in 2018, according to a report of the BPWA. A further 15,446 people were injured in a total of 5,514 road crashes throughout the year, the report added.Mozammel Haque Chowdhury, secretary general of the organization earlier said  the victims in 41.53 per cent of the reported cases died as a result of being run over by vehicles while 29.72 per cent of the deaths occurred in head-on collisions between vehicles.Around 16.18 per cent of the road crash casualties resulted from vehicles falling into ditches. The number of fatalities from road crashes in 2018 is lower than last year despite an increase in the number of reported accidents, according to the report.The report also found that 394 were killed in a total of 370 railway accidents while 248 people were injured in 2018.  Waterway accidents left 126 dead and 234 injured while 387 people were reported missing.Around 35 lakh motor vehicles are registered with Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) while the number of driving licences issued by the authorities is around 24.5 lakh.  ""Until we get enough trained drivers, the problem won't be solved,"" Khandaker Enayetullah, secretary general of Bangladesh Sarak Paribahan Malik Samity, said.At least 87 per cent buses and minibuses ply the roads in the capital recklessly in violation of traffic rules, creating anarchy in the public transport sector, said a passenger welfare platform citing its survey covering over one thousand vehicles.The mismanagement in the road transport sector, reckless driving and race among vehicles to pick passengers came to the fore recently after several passengers died or suffered grave injuries in avoidable accidents.The number of road accidents saw a marked rise in the last two years due to a growing number of motorcycles, says a new survey of Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa).""It is mainly the indiscipline in the sector. Most street accidents involving buses happen when someone is getting on or off a bus,"" Mozammel said.Issues identified by experts include undisciplined drivers, encroachments on roads, absence of adequate footpaths, misplaced foot over bridges and crossings and commuters ignoring existing overpasses.Above all, an unhealthy competition takes place among bus companies, leading to reckless and unlawful driving, speeding, bus ramming and a host of other bad practices that go virtually unchecked.Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) Additional Commissioner (traffic) in a recent said, ""Many drivers do not have valid licences. Police fails to strictly enforce traffic laws because of a lack of manpower in the traffic division.""",2019,Wednesday,24-Apr,,12:00 AM,"Wednesday, 24 April, 2019 at 12:00 AM",,,,,,1,1,

At least 7 people were killed under trucks and other motorized vehicles across the country. At least 13 brick-kiln workers were killed and five others injured when a coal-laden truck overturned on the labour shed of a brick field beside Dhaka-Chattogram Highway at Narayanpur in Chouddagram upazila on Friday.A new road transport law has not been implemented. Meanwhile, only about 20 per cent traffic accident victims took their cases to court as the conviction rate was very low, although there is no official data to confirm this figure.The new law specifies guidelines on the minimum age and academic qualifications for drivers, number of vehicles on a particular route, working hours for drivers and helpers of buses, trucks, covered vans and other vehicles, compensation for road crash victims, emergency helpline, among others. At least 7,221 people have died in road accidents across the country in 2018, according to a report by the Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Organisation.  A further 15,446 people were injured in a total of 5,514 road accidents throughout the year, the report added.At least 27,000 people died in road accidents across the country in the past four years.

""Heavy traffic jam in the city makes the transport workers more reckless as they fail to make targeted number of trips because of traffic jam, making drivers more aggressive as gridlock cuts down their income,"" they added. A growing number of motorcycles is mainly responsible for the sudden rise in accidents, says a new survey of Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa).

Last year 2018, the number of road accidents was around 3,200 -- the survey, based on reports published in mainstream newspapers. Ilias Kanchan, a road safety crusader, claimed that many underage bikers are careless on the road and speed recklessly, often causing accidents after losing control. ""That's why the number of accidents is on the rise,"" he said.He said a growing number of unskilled drivers of CNG-run auto-rickshaws, easy bikes and other three-wheelers also contribute to frequent road accidents.Kanchan said that a flawed transport system, mismanagement of owners, lack of monitoring, weak traffic management, lack of awareness among people, reckless speeding, poor road construction, lack of political will and lack of proper implementation of law are the other reasons behind road accidents.","Alarming rise in road accidents despite safety measures: The number of road accidents is rising alarmingly across the country, despite government measures to bring safety to road and highway users.  Lack of proper supervision, misuse of administrative powers of some influential people and lack of public awareness were identified as the major reasons behind the high number of road crashes.Law enforcement agencies have been reporting death in 'road accidents' almost every day.

At least 7,221 people have died in road accidents across the country in 2018, according to a report by the Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Organisation.  A further 15,446 people were injured in a total of 5,514 road accidents throughout the year, the report added.At least 27,000 people died in road accidents across the country in the past four years. This record shows 20 people die in road accidents in the country every day.Another 62,482 people were injured in the road accidents that occurred in four years, according to the organization and Accident Research Institute of BUET (Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology).A number of transportation experts believe that reckless drivers are the core reason behind the staggering number of road accidents in the country. ""Heavy traffic jam in the city makes the transport workers more reckless as they fail to make targeted number of trips because of traffic jam, making drivers more aggressive as gridlock cuts down their income,"" they added. A growing number of motorcycles is mainly responsible for the sudden rise in accidents, says a new survey of Nirapad Sarak Chai (Nischa). In 2016, the number of road accidents was 2,316, which grew to 3,349 in 2017. Last year 2018, the number of road accidents was around 3,200 -- the survey, based on reports published in mainstream newspapers. Ilias Kanchan, a road safety crusader, claimed that many underage bikers are careless on the road and speed recklessly, often causing accidents after losing control. ""That's why the number of accidents is on the rise,"" he said.He said a growing number of unskilled drivers of CNG-run auto-rickshaws, easy bikes and other three-wheelers also contribute to frequent road accidents.Kanchan said that a flawed transport system, mismanagement of owners, lack of monitoring, weak traffic management, lack of awareness among people, reckless speeding, poor road construction, lack of political will and lack of proper implementation of law are the other reasons behind road accidents.",2019,Tuesday,29-Jan,,12:00 AM,"Tuesday, 29 January, 2019 at 12:00 AM",,,,,,1,1,
