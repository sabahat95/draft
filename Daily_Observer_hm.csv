https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=266508,2020,21-Jul,Bacteria that eats metal discovered by accident after 100 years,"Bacteria that eats metal discovered by accident after 100 yearsScientists from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have discovered a kind of bacteria that eats metal. The bacteria have reportedly been suspected to exist for over a century but has not been proved.The tiny microbes were discovered by accident, as scientists were performing unrelated experiments with manganese, a mineral usually found in combination with iron. Dr. Jared Leadbetter, professor of environmental microbiology at Caltech, left a glass jar covered with the substance to soak in his office sink.He did not return to the office for several months while he was working off campus, but upon his return found the jar covered with a dark substance later found to be oxidised manganese. That compound was formed by the bacteria.Scientists had previously known that bacteria and fungi could oxidise manganese or strip it of electronics, but microbes that could use such actions to drive growth were yet to be discovered.""These are the first bacteria found to use manganese as their source of fuel,"" Leadbetter said. ""A wonderful aspect of microbes in nature is that they can metabolize seemingly unlikely materials, like metals, yielding energy useful to the cell.""""There is evidence that relatives of these creatures reside in groundwater, and a portion of Pasadena's drinking water is pumped from local aquifers,"" Leadbetter added, as reported by CNN.Groundwater is water present beneath the Earth's surface, located in cracks in soil, sand, and rocks. Bacteria can remove pollutants in water, through a process known as bioremediation, reducing the amount of manganese oxide in the same way that humans breathe air.Researchers can now better understand the chemistry of his phenomenon, which ""serves to supply the other microbes with what they need to perform reactions that we consider to be beneficial and desirable,"" Leadbetter said.Scientists also believe the discovery will better help them understand Earth's elemental cycles, and the way the metal has affected evolution on the planet. Manganese nodules are often found on the seafloor, and can be as large as grapefruits.Marine researchers on the HMS Challenger, in the 1870s, have been aware of their existence but unable to explain them. Recently, mining companies have planned to use these nodules as a source of rare metals. The findings were published in Nature.    -INDEPENDENT ","Nature, Bangladesh","Polwell Nature Park, রাঙ্গামাটি, রাঙ্গামাটি পার্বত্য জেলা, চট্টগ্রাম বিভাগ, 0351, বাংলাদেশ",22.6405667,92.1988585

The dead included eight women and three children. The witnesses and persons involved in the water transport sector claimed that it was the first accident for overtaking in and around Sadarghat.Unnecessary overtaking in haste caused the accident, said the witnesses. Rasu Miah Majhi, a witness to the accident, told this correspondent that 'MV Morning Bird' sank as     it attempted to overtake 'Mayur-2'. The launch was in a hurry to drop its passengers from Munshiganj to attend their offices or shops, he said.More than 100 passengers were aboard the 'MV Morning Bird' when it capsized in the river after it had been hit by the Mayur-2, he said. The Mayur-2 hit the back of the small water vessel. Among the passengers, around 50 people managed to swim ashore with the help of locals and the rests lost lives.The Fire Service authorities said 30 bodies had been recovered from the sunken launch and sent to the Sir Salimullah Medical College Mitford Hospital. Launch owner Rasel Miah and Master Mohammad Badal Mia told this correspondent that many private employees and businessmen come to Dhaka from Munshiganj every day. As most of the private employees travel in those vessels in the morning, the masters normally try to drop them quickly so that they can attend offices in time.The driver of 'Morning Bird' might have tried to reach the wharf quickly overtaking Mayur-2, they added. Mohammad Badal Mia, the In-Charge of 'Jamal-9', said usually small launches carry a large number of officials and employees and small traders. They come from different adjacent places of Dhaka for work. That is why the drivers of these launches try to reach Dhaka very fast, he added.About the accident on Monday Mohammad Badal Mia said although the Mayur-2 was at low speed it was not possible for it to stop it immediately. It would have been possible to avoid the accident if Mayur-2 had had some more time, he observed.However, Badal Mia noted that larger water vessels should give space to smaller ones if the small ones move closer to larger ones. Meanwhile, the Shipping Ministry has formed a seven-member inquiry committee with Joint Secretary (Development) of the Ministry of Shipping Md Rafiqul Islam Khan as the Convener. The committee was asked to submit its report to the Ministry of Shipping within the next seven days. ","Munshiganj, Bangladesh","মুন্সিগঞ্জ জেলা, ঢাকা বিভাগ, বাংলাদেশ",23.5483797,90.5349722
